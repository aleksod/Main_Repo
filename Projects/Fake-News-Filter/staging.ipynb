    "President Trump says that his executive order will provide quality health care to millions of Americans.\n",
    "The main way he would do this is to make it easier for small businesses to band together to buy health insurance through nationwide association health plans. The order will likely free these plans from several key Obamacare regulations and from state oversight. Instead, they'd be subject to the same federal regulations as large-employer plans.\n",
    "The key backer of this move, GOP Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, dismisses critics' concerns that association plans would hurt those who are sick and need care. Instead, he says it would allow small businesses to use their collective bargaining power to purchase the same level of coverage as large group plans.\n",
    "Powered by SmartAsset.com\n",
    "\n",
    "SMARTASSET.COM\n",
    "\"If you get group insurance under this proposal or any group insurance in this country, they can't discriminate,\" Paul said on MSNBC Friday. \"If you have a pre-existing condition, you can still get any group insurance in our country. The insurance that we're talking about through health associations is exactly the same insurance that big corporations like Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Amazon, Microsoft - this is what they have for their employees.\"\n",
    "Not so, say health policy experts.\n",
    "Related: What's in Trump's health care executive order?\n",
    "While much will depend on how the new regulations are written, the point of Trump's executive order is to let these association plans skirt Obamacare rules, said JoAnn Volk, project director at Georgetown's Center on Health Insurance Reforms.\n",
    "The Affordable Care Act provides sweeping protections for those with pre-existing conditions.\n",
    "Currently, the rates employers pay when they purchase coverage through the health reform law's small business marketplace aren't based on the health of their workers. They differ only by geographic location and the age of the employees. Also, the policies must cover all the essential health benefits laid out in the law.\n",
    "Large employers, however, don't have to adhere to all of Obamacare's rules. For instance, they don't have to provide comprehensive policies that cover prescription drugs, substance abuse and maternity benefits.\n",
    "Related: One way Trump could change health insurance\n",
    "It's true large companies can't exclude or charge higher premiums to individual workers based on their medical history, as Paul and the Trump administration are quick to point out. But the rates an employer pays as a whole are based on the health status of its workers.\n",
    "At big companies like Pepsi or Microsoft, there are usually enough young and healthy workers to offset the costs generated by those who are sick. Also, large employers usually offer good health benefits to attract and retain high-quality staffers, said Mila Kofman, executive director of the Washington D.C. health insurance exchange who has researched association health plans.\n",
    "But it's much more difficult to achieve that balance at a small firm with only a handful or workers. So it's likely association plans would try to cherry pick small businesses with younger and healthier staffers. They could do this by charging higher premiums or offering skimpier benefits to firms with older and sicker workers, or those with more women, who tend to use more health care services.\n",
    "Related: Trump kills key Obamacare subsidies: What it means\n",
    "Here's how it might work:\n",
    "Small nail salons around the country form the National Nail Polish Association to provide insurance. Salon A has 14 workers, eight of whom have diabetes or cancer. Salon B also has 14 workers, but only four have major illnesses.\n",
    "Neither salon can exclude or charge higher premiums to the workers with pre-existing conditions. But the National Nail Polish Association can charge all of Salon A's workers higher premiums because more are sick, while Salon B's employees can enjoy lower rates. Or the association can make its offerings unattractive to Salon A by not covering the treatments and medications that the workers need\n",
    "While those with pre-existing conditions could still get comprehensive individual coverage through the Obamacare exchanges, it's likely the premiums there would rise if many healthier enrollees are drawn in association plans.\n",
    "These are some of the main reasons why so many health care providers and patient advocacy groups have come out against Trump's executive order.\n",
    "\"This order has the potential to price millions of people with pre-existing conditions and serious illnesses out of the individual insurance market and put millions more at risk through the sale of insurance plans that won't cover all the services patients want to stay healthy or the critical care they need when they get sick,\" according to a joint statement issued Thursday by 18 patient organizations, including the Arthritis Foundation and the American Heart Association.\n",

    " </div> <p class=\"speakable\"> The key backer of this move, GOP Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, dismisses critics' concerns that association plans would hurt those who are sick and need care. Instead,<strong> </strong>he says it would allow small businesses to use their collective bargaining power to purchase the same level of coverage as large group plans. </p> <p> \"If you get group insurance under this proposal or any group insurance in this country, they can't discriminate,\" Paul said on MSNBC Friday. \"If you have a pre-existing condition, you can still get any group insurance in our country. The insurance that we're talking about through health associations is exactly the same insurance that big corporations like Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Amazon, Microsoft - this is what they have for their employees.\" </p> <p> Not so, say health policy experts. </p> <div id=\"ad_nat_btf_03\"></div> <p> <a href='http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/12/news/economy/trump-health-care-executive-order/index.html'><span class='inStoryHeading'>Related: What's in Trump's health care executive order?</span></a> </p> <p> While much will depend on how the new regulations are written, the point of Trump's <a href='http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/12/news/economy/trump-health-care-executive-order/index.html'>executive order</a> is to let these association plans skirt Obamacare rules,<strong> </strong>said JoAnn Volk, project director at Georgetown's Center on Health Insurance Reforms. </p> <p> The<strong> </strong>Affordable Care Ac<strong>t</strong> provides sweeping protections for those with pre-existing conditions. </p> <p> Currently, the rates employers pay when they purchase coverage through the health reform law's small business marketplace aren't based on the health of their workers. They differ only by geographic location and the age of the employees. Also, the policies must cover all the essential health benefits laid out in the law. </p> <p> Large employers, however, don't have to adhere to all of Obamacare's rules. For instance, they don't have to provide comprehensive policies that cover prescription drugs, substance abuse and maternity benefits. </p> <p> <a href='http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/05/news/economy/trump-insurance-association-health-plans/index.html?iid=EL'><span class='inStoryHeading'>Related: One way Trump could change health insurance</span></a> </p> <p> It's true large companies can't exclude or charge higher premiums to individual workers based on their medical history, as Paul and the Trump administration are quick to point out. But the rates an employer pays as a whole are based on the health status of its workers. </p> <p> At big companies like Pepsi or Microsoft, there are usually enough young and healthy workers to offset the costs generated by those who are sick. Also, large employers usually offer good health benefits to attract and retain high-quality staffers, said Mila Kofman, executive director of the Washington D.C. health insurance exchange who has researched association health plans. </p> <p> But it's much more difficult to achieve that balance at a small firm with only a handful or workers. So it's likely association plans would try to cherry pick small businesses with younger and healthier staffers. They could do this by charging higher premiums or offering skimpier benefits to firms with older and sicker workers, or those with more women, who tend to use more health care services. </p> <p> <a href='http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/13/news/economy/trump-obamacare-subsidies/index.html'><span class='inStoryHeading'>Related: Trump kills key Obamacare subsidies: What it means</span></a> </p> <p> Here's how it might work: </p> <p> Small nail salons around the country form the National Nail Polish Association to provide insurance. Salon A has 14 workers, eight of whom have diabetes or cancer. Salon B also has 14 workers, but only four have major illnesses. </p> <p> Neither salon can exclude or charge higher premiums to the<strong> </strong>workers with pre-existing conditions. But the National Nail<strong> </strong>Polish Association can charge all of Salon A's workers higher premiums because more are sick, while Salon B's employees can enjoy lower rates. Or the association can make its offerings unattractive to Salon A by not covering the treatments and medications that the workers need </p> <p> While those with pre-existing conditions could still get comprehensive individual coverage through the Obamacare exchanges, it's likely the premiums there would rise if many healthier enrollees are drawn in association plans. </p> <p> These are some of the main reasons why so many health care providers and patient advocacy groups have come out against Trump's executive order. </p> <p> \"This order has the potential to price millions of people with pre-existing conditions and serious illnesses out of the individual insurance market and put millions more at risk through the sale of insurance plans that won't cover all the services patients want to stay healthy or the critical care they need when they get sick,\" according to a joint statement issued Thursday by 18 patient organizations, including the Arthritis Foundation and the American Heart Association. </p> <div id=\"storyFooter\"></div> <div class=\"clearfix\"></div> <div class=\"storytimestamp\"> <span class=\"cnnStorySource\"> CNNMoney (New York) </span> <span class=\"cnnDateStamp\">First published October 14, 2017: 10:08 AM ET</span> </div> </div> <!--/storytext--> <div class=\"foot\"> <div id=\"postedin\"></div> <div class=\"clearFloat\"></div> </div> </div> </article> <div class=\"cnnoutbrain outbrain-recommended\" id=\"js-outbrain-recommended\"></div>\n",

    "<p>“The Iran deal was, as the president said, a bad deal, possibly the worse in modern history. We should kill it. That’s what I recommended the president do, but I’m happy to see him decertify it,” Dr. Sebastian Gorka, a former deputy assistant to President Trump, told Breitbart News.</p>\n",
    "<p>“As far as the Iran deal goes, I am very pleased to see that he, as expected, decided not to recertify the Iran nuclear deal, officially known as the JCPOA [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action],” <a href=\"https://www.centerforsecuritypolicy.org/tag/clare-lopez/\">Clare Lopez</a>, the president of research and analysis at the Center for Security Policy, told Breitbart News. “I would like to see him go further, of course, and the reason is that Iran is in blatant breach of the JCPOA.”</p>\n",
    "<p>Lopez pointed out that President Trump does not need Congress to ditch the nuclear deal, which she argues has failed to prevent Iran from further developing its nuclear program.</p>\n",
    "<p>She said that Iran has made sure to keep its “clandestine nuclear program” running since 1988, adding, “I sincerely hope the president is planning to end the deal because it does not affect Iran’s clandestine nuclear program.”</p><div class=\"ad adinbody Hmobi\"><div class=\"inbodyad\" id=\"desktop-ROS-Body1\"></div></div>\n",

    "<p>“They have not stopped. They have not slowed. They have not paused the illicit clandestine nuclear programs,” she continued, referring to Tehran&#8217;s nuclear activities. “The JCPOA has no provisions for inspecting the off-limit military sites, which are the places where Iran is developing its clandestine nuclear weapons.”</p>\n",
    "<p>Gorka and Lopez noted that Trump should have seized the opportunity to officially label the IRCG a <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2017/02/08/trump-considering-designating-irans-revolutionary-guard-corps-terrorist-group/\">terrorist group</a> when announcing his administration’s new Iran strategy.</p>\n",
    "<p>“The president should have decertified the Iran deal and at the same time designate the IRCG a terrorist group,” declared Gorka. “The IRGC is a menace and a threat to our national interest and the safety of our allies and partners.”</p>\n",
    "<p>During his speech, Trump noted that the IRGC poses a terrorist threat to the United States, “but then he held back,” noted Lopez.</p>\n",
    "<p>However, Gorka added, “I think the statement today makes the [terrorism] designation [for the Revolutionary Guards] more likely.”</p>\n",

    "<p>&#8220;The Revolutionary Guard is the Iranian supreme leader&#8217;s corrupt personal terror force and militia. It has hijacked large portions of Iran’s economy and seized massive religious endowments to fund war and terror abroad,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;This includes arming the Syrian dictator, supplying proxies and partners with missiles and weapons to attack civilians in the region, and even plotting to bomb a popular restaurant right here in Washington, DC.&#8221;</p>\n",
    "<p>The U.S. military has long <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2017/07/21/state-islamic-state-hezbollah-continue-find-home-latin-america/\">warned</a> against the presence of Iran and its proxies — Hezbollah and IRGC —throughout the Western Hemisphere, including the United States.</p>\n",
    "<p>Various officials from within the Iranian government and IRGC recently <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2017/10/12/iran-revolutionary-guards-vows-treat-u-s-enemy-trump-makes-stupid-decision/\">threatened</a> to attack American troops if Trump deems the Guards as a terrorist organization.</p>\n",

    "<p>Along with the millions of dollars generated from the drug trade and other illicit activity in Latin America, the sanction relief funds have allowed Hezbollah to establish “operational cells all over the United States,” declared Lopez, <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2017/10/12/top-u-s-official-hezbollah-maintains-presence-u-s-determined-attack/\">echoing</a> the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center (NCC).</p>\n",
    "<p>The nefarious activities of state-sponsor of terrorism Iran “actually got worse” under the 2015 nuclear deal, said Dr. Gorka.</p>\n",
    "<p>Dr. Gorka stated that he and former White House Chief Strategist Stephen K. Bannon, who returned as executive chairman of Breitbart News in August, pushed against certifying the Iran deal earlier this year.</p>\n",
    "<p>Meanwhile, National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin advocated for certification, he added, noting that President Trump was angry about having to recertify a deal he had repeatedly denounced as one of the worst in history.</p>\n",

    "             WASHINGTON, DC — Some experts welcomed U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to decertify the Iran nuclear deal, but they said the American leader should have gone a step further and killed the agreement, which some analysts argue has strengthened Tehran’s narco-terror proxy Hezbollah and its hard-line Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).\n",
    "While some analysts praised Trump for decertifying the Iran deal, others stressed that the president did not go far enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The Iran deal was, as the president said, a bad deal, possibly the worse in modern history. We should kill it. That’s what I recommended the president do, but I’m happy to see him decertify it,” Dr. Sebastian Gorka, a former deputy assistant to President Trump, told Breitbart News.\n",
    "\n",
    "“As far as the Iran deal goes, I am very pleased to see that he, as expected, decided not to recertify the Iran nuclear deal, officially known as the JCPOA [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action],” Clare Lopez, the president of research and analysis at the Center for Security Policy, told Breitbart News. “I would like to see him go further, of course, and the reason is that Iran is in blatant breach of the JCPOA.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Lopez pointed out that President Trump does not need Congress to ditch the nuclear deal, which she argues has failed to prevent Iran from further developing its nuclear program.\n",
    "\n",
    "She said that Iran has made sure to keep its “clandestine nuclear program” running since 1988, adding, “I sincerely hope the president is planning to end the deal because it does not affect Iran’s clandestine nuclear program.”\n",
    "\n",
    "advertisement\n",
    "“They have not stopped. They have not slowed. They have not paused the illicit clandestine nuclear programs,” she continued, referring to Tehran’s nuclear activities. “The JCPOA has no provisions for inspecting the off-limit military sites, which are the places where Iran is developing its clandestine nuclear weapons.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Gorka and Lopez noted that Trump should have seized the opportunity to officially label the IRCG a terrorist group when announcing his administration’s new Iran strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The president should have decertified the Iran deal and at the same time designate the IRCG a terrorist group,” declared Gorka. “The IRGC is a menace and a threat to our national interest and the safety of our allies and partners.”\n",
    "\n",
    "During his speech, Trump noted that the IRGC poses a terrorist threat to the United States, “but then he held back,” noted Lopez.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Gorka added, “I think the statement today makes the [terrorism] designation [for the Revolutionary Guards] more likely.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The president did say that his administration will impose “tough sanctions on Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps” as part of his Iran strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The Revolutionary Guard is the Iranian supreme leader’s corrupt personal terror force and militia. It has hijacked large portions of Iran’s economy and seized massive religious endowments to fund war and terror abroad,” he explained. “This includes arming the Syrian dictator, supplying proxies and partners with missiles and weapons to attack civilians in the region, and even plotting to bomb a popular restaurant right here in Washington, DC.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The U.S. military has long warned against the presence of Iran and its proxies — Hezbollah and IRGC —throughout the Western Hemisphere, including the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "Various officials from within the Iranian government and IRGC recently threatened to attack American troops if Trump deems the Guards as a terrorist organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dr. Gorka acknowledged that the billions of dollars in unfrozen assets released to Iran as part of the Iran deal have strengthened Iran’s narco-terrorist proxy Hezbollah and the IRGC.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2015, both Gen. Martin Dempsey, Obama’s chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the former president himself conceded that Iran would use nuclear deal-linked sanctions relief money to proliferate terrorist activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along with the millions of dollars generated from the drug trade and other illicit activity in Latin America, the sanction relief funds have allowed Hezbollah to establish “operational cells all over the United States,” declared Lopez, echoing the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center (NCC).\n",
    "\n",
    "The nefarious activities of state-sponsor of terrorism Iran “actually got worse” under the 2015 nuclear deal, said Dr. Gorka.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dr. Gorka stated that he and former White House Chief Strategist Stephen K. Bannon, who returned as executive chairman of Breitbart News in August, pushed against certifying the Iran deal earlier this year.\n",
    "\n",
