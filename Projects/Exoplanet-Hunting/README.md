# Hunting for Exoplanets Using Machine Learning
---

This is a classifier designed to discover exoplanet-containing stars using only light flux data. The flux data was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/keplersmachines/kepler-labelled-time-series-data). See [my blog post](https://aleksod.github.io/Exoplanet-Hunter/) for visualizations and slides.
