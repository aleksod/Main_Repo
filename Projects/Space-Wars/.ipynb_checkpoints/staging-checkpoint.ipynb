       "[\"Title: Deadlock\\nStardate: 49548.7\\nOriginal Airdate: March 18 1996\\n\\n\\n[Mess Hall]\\n\\nNEELIX: Good afternoon, Ensign. How are we doing today?\\nWILDMAN: Oh, we're doing just fine, thank you.\\nNEELIX: Good, good. Er, by the way, I was wondering if you'd take a look\\nat the thermal array in the kitchen. It overloaded this morning and\\nvaporised an entire pot roast.\\nWILDMAN: I'd be happy to.\\nNEELIX: Wonderful. I informed Ensign Kim about the problem hours ago, and\\nhe still hasn't come down to fix it.\\nWILDMAN: He's been working on a problem with the structural integrity\\ngrid. I'm sure he hasn't forgotten about you.\\nNEELIX: If this thing doesn't get fixed soon, we'll all be eating cold\\nleftovers for dinner and who do you think the crew will blame?\\nWILDMAN: Looks like you need a new set of anodyne relays. I'll go down to\\nEngineering and get some for you out of storage.\\nNEELIX: Thanks. Oh, and er, while you're here, would you mind taking a\\nlook at the replicator? It's been having trouble making anything with\\nlarge amounts of cellulose.\\nWILDMAN: Of course.\\nNEELIX: Cabbages, psyllium, green beans, celery and all. It all comes out\\nlooking a touch too yellow.\\nWILDMAN: I thought you didn't use replicated vegetables when you're\\ncooking. Always fresh, organic, from the airponic bay.\\nNEELIX: Oh, well, the yields have been a little low lately. And normally,\\nI would never dream of using synthesised veggies.\\nWILDMAN: It looks like a malfunction in the power grid. Shouldn't be too\\ndifficult.\\nNEELIX: What's wrong?\\nWILDMAN: I think I'm having a contraction. Oh, yeah! It's a contraction,\\nall right.\\nNEELIX: That's wonderful. Labour can't be far behind. Let's, let's get\\nyou to Sickbay. Try to breathe now. Deep, deep regular breaths. Not so\\nfast now. We're having a baby.\\n\\n[Sickbay]\\n\\nEMH: Push!\\nKES: Don't forget to breathe, Samantha. Deep regular breaths. That's it.\\nEMH: Cervical dilation is at ten point two centimetres. Prostaglandin\\nlevels are normal. Push, Ensign.\\nWILDMAN: You push, damn it! I'm sick of pushing!\\nEMH: I know you're fatigued. Try to focus on your breathing. Remember the\\nexercises we did. When you feel a contraction, bear down.\\n\\n[Bridge]\\n\\nPARIS: This is ridiculous. It's been seven hours. How long does it take\\nto deliver a baby?\\nJANEWAY: As long as it takes, Mister Paris.\\nTUVOK: Indeed. During the birth of our third child, my wife was in labour\\nfor ninety six hours.\\nKIM: Four days?\\nTUVOK: I have learned that pregnancy and patience go hand in hand.\\nCHAKOTAY: You know, I didn't expect to be this nervous. It's not even my\\nchild.\\nJANEWAY: In a way, this child belongs to all of us. It is the first baby\\nborn on Voyager. I'm just not sure whether I should be welcoming it on\\nboard, or apologising.\\nCHAKOTAY: Captain?\\nJANEWAY: Voyager isn't exactly anyone's idea of a nursery, and the Delta\\nQuadrant isn't much of a playground.\\nCHAKOTAY: My father had a saying, Captain. 'Home is wherever you happen\\nto be.'\\nTUVOK: Captain, long-range sensors are picking up heavy subspace\\ncommunications ahead. They're Vidiian.\\nJANEWAY: All stop. A ship?\\nTUVOK: At least twenty ships within sensor range. I am also detecting a\\nG-type star system with two inhabited planets. Life signs, Vidiian.\\nCHAKOTAY: Sounds like we're headed right into their territory.\\nJANEWAY: And I'm in no mood to donate any organs today. Options, Mister\\nParis?\\nPARIS: There's a large plasma drift bearing forty mark seven. It extends\\nalmost half the length of this sector. Interference from the plasma\\nshould block us from their sensors.\\nJANEWAY: Good thinking. Lay in a course at full impulse. Mister Tuvok,\\ndeflectors at maximum.\\n\\n[Sickbay]\\n\\nWILDMAN: Oh! Oh, what was that?\\nEMH: What's wrong?\\nWILDMAN: A pain in my abdomen. It's different. Sharp. Oh, God!\\nEMH: The baby has shifted position, and its exo-cranial ridges have\\nlodged in the uterine wall. This is a rare complication, but it's been\\nknown to happen in human-Ktarian pregnancies.\\nKES: Can we reposition the baby?\\nEMH: No. Its spinal column is too fragile. I don't want to risk nerve\\ndamage. If we don't deliver the baby now, its ridges could perforate the\\nuterus and cause internal bleeding. Kes, prepare for a foetal transport.\\n\\n[Bridge]\\n\\nPARIS: We're clearing the Vidiian system, Captain.\\nJANEWAY: Take us out of the plasma drift and resume our previous course.\\n\\n[Sickbay]\\n\\nEMH: I've locked onto the baby's co-ordinates. We're ready to begin.\\nInitiating umbilical separation. Energising. Congratulations, Ensign.\\nIt's a girl.\\nWILDMAN: Is she all right?\\nEMH: The transport caused a slight hemocythemic imbalance, but we'll\\nstabilise her cell membranes with osmotic pressure therapy.\\n\\n[Bridge]\\n\\nJANEWAY: What was that?\\nKIM: We hit some kind of subspace turbulence as we were coming out of the\\nplasma drift. I can't tell if\\nPARIS: What the hell? Captain, the warp engines just stalled.\\nJANEWAY: Go to impulse.\\nPARIS: Impulse engines aren't responding. Manoeuvring thrusters are out\\ntoo.\\nKIM: We're losing main power. Switching to back up power.\\nJANEWAY: Red alert. Bridge to Engineering. Report.\\n\\n[Engineering]\\n\\nTORRES: Our antimatter supply is being drained, Captain. I don't know\\nwhy. The containment fields are in place. It's like we sprung a leak, but\\nI can't find the crack.\\n\\n[Bridge]\\n\\nJANEWAY: B'Elanna, try infusing the warp core with repeated proton\\nbursts. That should be enough to keep it going.\\n\\n[Engineering]\\n\\nTORRES: I think I can generate enough protons in the sensor array for a\\nburst every thirty seconds.\\nJANEWAY [OC]: Do it.\\nTORRES: Hogan! These proton bursts are going to cause a lot of stress on\\nthe hull. Reinforce structural integrity to - now what?\\n\\n[Bridge]\\n\\nCHAKOTAY: What was that?\\nTUVOK: It appeared to be a proton burst.\\nJANEWAY: Already? Bridge to Torres. Report. Engineering, respond.\\nKIM: Captain, three EPS conduits just ruptured in Engineering. They took\\nheavy casualties.\\n\\n[Sickbay]\\n\\nEMH: The incubator is losing power. Activate the auxiliary respirator.\\nCREWMAN: We've got wounded here.\\nEMH: Second degree plasma burns on the face and neck. Treat him with a\\ndermaline gel.\\nCREWMAN: Yes, sir.\\nEMH: Fractured clavicle, thoracic contusions, nothing serious. She can\\nwait. Fused vertebrae. Prep him for surgery. Status?\\nKES: It doesn't look good, Doctor. The baby's cell membranes won't\\nstabilise.\\nEMH: Increase the osmotic. That's not helping. Increase the osmotic\\npressure ratio by ten percent.\\nKIM [OC]: Bridge to Sickbay, there's been a major coolant leak in the\\nMess Hall. You've got more wounded on the way.\\nEMH: Acknowledged.\\n\\n[Engineering]\\n\\nTORRES: Torres to Bridge! We're definitely being, we're definitely being\\nhit by proton bursts. But I don't know where they're coming from. I never\\neven started the procedure.\\n\\n[Bridge]\\n\\nKIM: She's right. The main sensor array is off-line. Not a single burst\\nwas fired.\\nJANEWAY: And yet the bursts appear to be originating from within the\\nship. It's like they're coming out of thin air.\\nTUVOK: Captain, these burst are weakening the structural integrity of the\\nhull. We cannot take any more.\\nJANEWAY: Can we increase power to structural reinforcement?\\nKIM: Our antimatter supply is too low. There's just not enough power to go\\nTUVOK: Hull breach on deck fifteen, section twenty nine alpha. Emergency\\nforce fields are off-line.\\nKIM: Captain, I've been working on a way to enhance our portable force\\nfield generators. It might be enough to seal that breach.\\nJANEWAY: Go.\\n\\n[Sickbay]\\n\\nNEELIX: Don't you worry. We have the best doctor in the quadrant.\\nKES: Doctor, her cell membranes are losing cohesion.\\nEMH: Try remodulating the osmotic pressure.\\nKES: No effect.\\nEMH: Hang on. I'll be right there. Oh, no.\\n\\n[Corridor]\\n\\nKIM: Jefferies tube twelve runs right over the breach. If we can get\\nclose enough, we should be able to set up a portable containment field.\\nHOGAN: The breach has weakened the integrity of that tube by twenty two\\npercent.\\nTORRES: That's why we need to reinforce the field. We'll use the power\\nconduits on this deck.\\n\\n[Bridge]\\n\\nTUVOK: I've analysed the bursts on all spectral frequencies. There's\\nstill no indication of where they're coming from.\\nJANEWAY: At this point, I don't give a damn where they're coming from. I\\njust want to stop them. Chakotay, do we have enough auxiliary power to\\nmagnetise the hull? It might cushion the impact of the bursts.\\nCHAKOTAY: We have just barely enough.\\nJANEWAY: Give it a try.\\n\\n[Sickbay]\\n\\nEMH: I stabilised my imaging array but it could go out at any time.\\nWILDMAN: Doctor?\\nEMH: Prepare for emergency resuscitation.\\nWILDMAN: My baby, she, she's going to die, isn't she?\\nEMH: Not if I can help it.\\n\\n[Jefferies Tube]\\n\\nKIM: Here it is. The breach is directly below us.\\nTORRES: Make it fast, Harry. Torres to Hogan. What's your status?\\n\\n[Corridor]\\n\\nHOGAN: Almost got it, Lieutenant. I'm rerouting all power in this section\\nto your\\n\\n[Jefferies Tube]\\n\\nTORRES: Torres to Hogan.\\n\\n[Corridor]\\n\\nTORRES [OC]: Hogan, are you there?\\nHOGAN: I'm hurt.\\n\\n[Jefferies Tube]\\n\\nTORRES: Harry. We have to help him.\\nKIM: Just give me a minute.\\n\\n[Sickbay]\\n\\nEMH: Again.\\nKES: Nothing.\\nEMH: I'm sorry, Ensign.\\n\\n[Corridor]\\n\\nHOGAN: Hogan to Sickbay. I need medical assistance. Deck fifteen, section\\ntwenty nine.\\n\\n[Sickbay]\\n\\nKES: I'll go.\\n\\n[Jefferies Tube]\\n\\nTORRES: The breach is widening. Let's get out of here. Damn it, Harry!\\nLet's go!\\nKIM: Hold on. My minute isn't up yet.\\nTORRES: Harry, grab my hand! Harry!\\n\\n[Corridor]\\n\\nKES: Lieutenant Hogan?\\nTORRES: Kes, over here. Torres to Bridge. Ensign Kim is dead.\\n\\n[Bridge]\\n\\nTORRES [OC]: Kes just disappeared.\\nJANEWAY: Disappeared?\\nTORRES [OC]: I can't explain it.\\n\\n[Corridor]\\n\\nTORRES: She just vanished. There seems to be some kind of spatial rift.\\n\\n[Bridge]\\n\\nTORRES [OC]: Right where she disappeared.\\nJANEWAY: Can you determine where it leads?\\n\\n[Corridor]\\n\\nTORRES: Stand by, Bridge. I just threw a piece of conduit into the rift.\\nJust as it vanished, I detected another oxygen nitrogen atmosphere.\\n\\n[Bridge]\\n\\nJANEWAY: Another atmosphere?\\n\\n[Corridor]\\n\\nTORRES: Whatever's on the other side of that rift, there's air. Maybe Kes\\nis still alive.\\n\\n[Bridge]\\n\\nJANEWAY: Get out of there, Torres! The hull breach is widening. I'm going\\nto evacuate the entire deck.\\n\\n[Corridor]\\n\\nTORRES: You don't have to tell me twice.\\n\\n[Bridge]\\n\\nTUVOK: Main computer core is failing. Switching to back up processors.\\nJANEWAY: Chakotay, are you ready to magnetise the hull?\\nCHAKOTAY: Stand by. I'm having trouble with the alignment module.\\nJANEWAY: Try remodulating the field emitters. Chakotay!\\nCHAKOTAY: I've got alignment. Magnetising the hull. I think it worked.\\nJANEWAY: Let's hope so. I want a full damage report from all decks.\\nPARIS: Are you all right, Captain?\\nJANEWAY: It's just a scratch.\\nPARIS: It's more than a scratch. Maybe you should go to\\nJANEWAY: I'm fine, Lieutenant.\\nTUVOK: Damage reports are coming in. The hull breach on deck fifteen has\\nwidened to include deck fourteen, section twelve. And there are six\\nhundred thirty two micro-fractures along the hull's infrastructure. All\\nprimary systems are off-line. We are running on emergency power only. The\\nantimatter supply has dropped to eighteen percent and is continuing to\\nfall. Warp coils in both nacelles have fused and are inoperative. The\\nenvironmental control systems are failing. 15 crew members have been\\nseriously wounded with plasma burns, twenty seven experienced other\\ninjuries. The Doctor is setting up triage facilities in Sickbay and\\nHolodeck two. I must also regretfully report that Ensign Wildman's baby\\ndid not survive.\\nJANEWAY: I want an engineering team to seal those micro-fractures before\\nthey become breaches.\\nTUVOK: Aye, Captain.\\nJANEWAY: Mister Paris, grab a medical tricorder and go assist the Doctor.\\nPARIS: Right.\\nJANEWAY: Commander, you have the Bridge. I'm going to go talk to Ensign\\nWildman. Maybe I can help.\\nCHAKOTAY: The magnetic field is collapsing. The hull is depolarising!\\nTUVOK: The fire suppression system is out.\\nCOMPUTER: Warning. Hull breach on deck one. Emergency force fields\\ninoperative.\\nCHAKOTAY: Everybody out! Go, go, go! Hurry, Captain!\\nJANEWAY: I'm trying to reroute emergency power to the field emitters!\\nCHAKOTAY: Captain!\\nJANEWAY: I can seal this breach!\\nCHAKOTAY: Captain, let's go!\\n\\n(Note to readers: damaged Voyager and crew will now be suffixed '1',\\nwhile undamaged Voyager and crew will be suffixed '2'.)\\n\\n[Voyager 2 - Bridge]\\n\\nCHAKOTAY 2: Captain?\\nJANEWAY 2: Ensign Kim, scan the Bridge. I just saw myself cross the\\nBridge and enter that turbolift. It was very faint, almost like a ghost\\nimage. And I looked like hell.\\nKIM 2: Captain, there was a minor spatial fluctuation on the Bridge. But\\nit was only there for a millisecond.\\nJANEWAY 2: Bridge to Engineering. B'Elanna, how long until we can use the\\nmain sensor array?\\nTORRES 2 [OC]: Another three hours.\\n\\n[Voyager 2 - Engineering]\\n\\nTORRES 2: We're only about halfway through the proton burst procedure.\\n\\n[Voyager 2 - Bridge]\\n\\nJANEWAY 2: See if you can speed up the process. We need the sensors as\\nsoon as possible.\\n\\n[Voyager 2 - Engineering]\\n\\nTORRES 2: Understood.\\n\\n[Voyager 2 - Bridge]\\n\\nJANEWAY 2: Mister Kim, modify a tricorder to scan for spatial anomalies.\\nGo over every centimetre of this Bridge. Examine the sensor logs from our\\ntrip through the plasma drift. Look for anything unusual. I'll be in\\nSickbay.\\nCHAKOTAY 2: Aye, Captain.\\n\\n[Voyager 2 - Sickbay]\\n\\nEMH 2: Good news, Ensign. Our baby is perfectly healthy. There's no sign\\nof any interspecies abnormalities.\\nWILDMAN 2: Our baby?\\nEMH 2: A figure of speech. I am, in part, responsible for bringing her\\ninto the world. You may hold her now.\\nWILDMAN 2: Hello there.\\nJANEWAY 2: Congratulations, Samantha. She's adorable. Have you thought of\\na name?\\nWILDMAN 2: Not yet. I really thought it would be a boy.\\nJANEWAY 2: Let me know as soon as you decide. I've been making a blanket\\nfor her. All that's missing is an initial. Get some rest. How's our other\\npatient doing?\\nEMH 2: She's still unconscious.\\nKES 2: I ran a microcellular scan. We're almost identical in every way.\\nJANEWAY 2: Almost?\\nEMH 2: There's a slight phase-shift in her DNA. Do you have any theory\\nabout where she came from?\\nJANEWAY 2: Not yet. But I intend to find out. Can you wake her?\\nEMH 2: I believe so.\\nJANEWAY 2: Good, because I think she's going to have an interesting story\\nto tell.\\nKES 1: I was running through the corridor with my medkit. Deck 15. And\\nthen suddenly I felt dizzy, and my vision started to blur. After that, I\\ndon't remember anything, until you woke me up just now.\\nKES 2: You were found unconscious down on Deck 15, holding a medkit.\\nJANEWAY 2: We also found this lying next to you. It's a piece of damaged\\nconduit. Our analysis shows it's from Voyager, Deck fifteen, section\\ntwenty nine alpha, bulkhead oh five two. But there's no damage to deck\\nfifteen or anywhere else on this ship.\\nKES 1: There was massive damage to deck fifteen.\\nJANEWAY 2: The evidence would seem to suggest that you've come from a\\ndifferent ship, a different Voyager. We did find a spatial rift on deck\\nfifteen. It's possible that it somehow connects us to this other Voyager.\\nEMH 2: If you're right, where is the other ship? A parallel universe?\\nAnother dimension? Another point in time?\\nJANEWAY 2: I'm not sure. Almost everything about the Voyager Kes\\ndescribed is identical to ours. We've had similar experiences, similar\\npersonal histories. We both entered a plasma cloud to avoid the Vidiians.\\nBoth of our engines stalled as we left the cloud, which caused both of\\nour antimatter supplies to drain. And then we both decided to keep our\\nengines running by emitting proton bursts. But after that, our\\nexperiences diverged. We started emitting the proton bursts. They didn't.\\nKES 1: Our ship was being damaged by proton bursts. We couldn't figure\\nout where they were coming from.\\nJANEWAY 2: That's more than a coincidence. Janeway to Engineering.\\nB'Elanna, I want you to stop the proton bursts immediately.\\n\\n[Voyager 2 - Engineering]\\n\\nTORRES 2: But if we stop now, the power levels will drop\\nJANEWAY 2 [OC]: I'll explain later, Lieutenant.\\nTORRES 2: Understood.\\n\\n[Voyager 2 - Sickbay]\\n\\nJANEWAY 2: I don't know how, but there's another Voyager out there, and I\\nintend to find it.\\n\\n[Voyager 2 - Bridge]\\n\\nCHAKOTAY 2: We analysed the sensor logs from our trip through the plasma\\ncloud. We couldn't find anything unusual until we ran a quantum-level\\nanalysis. Remember that subspace turbulence we hit just before we left\\nthe cloud?\\nJANEWAY 2: Yes.\\nCHAKOTAY 2: Well, watch what happens.\\nKIM 2: At first, we thought it was a sensor aberration, but they were in\\nperfect calibration at the time.\\nTORRES 2: So I ran a multi-spectral analysis on the subspace turbulence.\\nIt was more than just turbulence. It was some kind of divergence field.\\nAnd the moment we passed through it, all of our sensor readings doubled.\\nMass, energy output, bio- signatures, everything. Every particle of\\nmatter on this ship seems to have been duplicated in that instant.\\nJANEWAY 2: So where is the other ship?\\nKIM 2: As strange as it sounds, Captain, according to these readings,\\nanother Voyager's right here, right now, occupying the same point in\\nspace-time we are.\\nJANEWAY 2: Quantum theorists at Kent State University ran an experiment\\nin which a single particle of matter was duplicated using a divergence of\\nsubspace fields, a spatial scission.\\nCHAKOTAY 2: If the same forces were at work inside the plasma cloud, they\\nmay have duplicated every particle of matter on Voyager.\\nJANEWAY 2: Matter. But not antimatter.\\nKIM 2: Captain?\\nJANEWAY 2: In that Kent State experiment, they were able to duplicate\\nnormal matter. But when they tried to duplicate antimatter particles, the\\nexperiment failed.\\nTORRES 2: So the antimatter on the ships wasn't duplicated. Both engines\\nhave been trying to draw power from a single source of antimatter.\\nJANEWAY 2: Like Siamese twins linked at the chest, with only one heart.\\nCHAKOTAY 2: So what do we do?\\nJANEWAY 2: I don't know. But whatever it is, we're going to have to\\nco-ordinate it with the other ship. Start working on a way to communicate\\nwith them.\\nTORRES 2: Right.\\nJANEWAY 2: The only link we know of is on deck fifteen, the spatial rift.\\nWe're going to need a way to send Kes back through safely.\\nKIM 2: We could rig a portable phase discriminator. It might protect her\\nfrom the spatial transition.\\nJANEWAY 2: Get on it!\\n\\n[Voyager 2 - Sickbay]\\n\\nWILDMAN 2: When can I start breast feeding?\\nEMH 2: Right away. However, I should forewarn you that her incisors will\\nerupt within three to four weeks. Since your skin lacks the scales of a\\nKtarian, we'll have to discuss alternatives.\\nWILDMAN 2: When can I take her home?\\nEMH 2: In twenty four hours. I want observe the infant to make sure\\nthere's no more damage to her cell membranes.\\nKES 2: You're welcome to stay the night so you may be with her.\\nWILDMAN 2: I'd like that. Hey.\\n\\n[Kes 1's memory]\\n\\nEMH: Congratulations, Ensign. It's a girl. I've stabilised my imaging\\narray, but it could go out at any rate.\\nKES: Doctor, her cell membranes are losing cohesion.\\nEMH: Try remodulating the osmotic pressure.\\nKES: No effect.\\nEMH: Again.\\nKES: Nothing.\\nWILDMAN: My baby. She's going to die, isn't she?\\nEMH: I'm sorry, Ensign.\\nWILDMAN: She's going to die, isn't she?\\n\\n[Sickbay]\\n\\nEMH 2: Kes. Kes! Are you all right?\\nKES 1: Yes. It's just. The baby's crying, it was like a bad memory.\\nEMH 2: What do you mean?\\nKES 1: On my Voyager, during the delivery, there were complications. We\\nperformed a foetal transport.\\nEMH 2: The same thing happened here. The transport was successful.\\nKES 1: On my ship, the medical systems were heavily damaged. The osmotic\\npressure therapy didn't work. The baby died.\\nEMH 2: I'm sorry to hear that. But try to understand, it wasn't your\\nfault. The situation was out of your control.\\nKES 1: Doctor, I've got to get back to my ship. They need my help.\\nEMH 2: The Captain's working on it, Kes. In the meantime, try to get some\\nrest. Besides, I'm sure your Voyager is also equipped with a proficient\\nEmergency Medical Hologram.\\n\\n[Voyager 2 - Engineering]\\n\\nTORRES 2: It's a little harder to establish a comm. link than I thought,\\nCaptain. The molecular signature of the second Voyager is slightly out of\\nphase with our own. I can't get visual, audio, nothing.\\nJANEWAY 2: Have you tried remodulating the comm. frequency carrier?\\nTORRES 2: Five times on forty seven different frequencies.\\nJANEWAY 2: There has to be a way. If they were recalibrating their\\ncarrier wave at the same time so we could match phase variance, would\\nthat allow us to connect?\\nTORRES 2: I think so, but in order to get them to do that, we'd have to\\ncommunicate with them first. It's the chicken and the egg.\\nJANEWAY 2: Maybe we need something a little more primitive. Is there a\\nsignal we could emit on all subspace bands just to get their attention?\\nTORRES 2: A rotating band pulse might do it, but it wouldn't be much more\\nthan a shrill whistle.\\nJANEWAY 2: That might be enough. Give it a try.\\n\\n[Voyager 1 - Engineering]\\n\\nTORRES 1: All right, Captain. All of the ship's command functions have\\nbeen re-routed to Main Engineering.\\nJANEWAY 1: Welcome to the new bridge. Now, let's see about. What's that?\\nTORRES 1: I don't know. It's some kind of Conn emission coming through\\nall subspace bands.\\nJANEWAY 1: Coming from where?\\nTORRES 1: Good question. I can't tell. But it's got a Federation\\nsignature.\\nJANEWAY 1: Try recalibrating our frequency carrier to match it.\\n\\n[Voyager 2 - Engineering]\\n\\nTORRES 2: That's it! They recalibrated and locked onto our phase variant.\\nJANEWAY 2: What kind of communication can we establish?\\nTORRES 2: Not much at this point. We can use the emergency encryption\\ncode for a short message. Not more than five seconds.\\nJANEWAY 2: That should be enough.\\n\\n[Voyager 1 - Engineering]\\n\\nJANEWAY 1: That's the emergency code. Run it through an alphanumeric\\nsequencer.\\nTORRES 1: I think someone's telling us to lock onto a frequency of twelve\\ngigahertz.\\nJANEWAY 1: Do it.\\nTORRES 1: I'll try to clear it up.\\nJANEWAY 2 [on monitor]: Captain, this isn't an illusion. What you're\\nseeing is real, but it's going to take some explaining.\\n\\nCHAKOTAY 1: There are two Voyagers and two crews?\\nJANEWAY 1: That's what I was told.\\nTUVOK 1: Could this possibly be some kind of subterfuge, Captain? An\\nalien deception?\\nJANEWAY 1: That woman, whoever she is, had very specific knowledge of\\nwhat happened here. The damage from the proton bursts, Wildman's baby,\\nKes disappearing. She even knew that when I was twelve years old, I\\nwalked home in a thunderstorm over seven kilometres because I lost a\\ntennis match.\\nTORRES 1: And her explanation of how the ship were duplicated, certainly\\nplausible.\\nPARIS 1: If it is true, what do we do about it?\\nJANEWAY 1: My counterpart has suggested we try to merge the two ships.\\nRecreate the subspace divergence field we passed through and then\\ndepolarise it.\\nTORRES 1: Both ships would have to send out a massive resonance pulse\\nfrom their deflector dishes at exactly the same time.\\nCHAKOTAY 1: They may be able to do that, but we barely have enough power\\nfor life support. How can we get enough to send an energy pulse of that\\nsize?\\nJANEWAY 1: We could evacuate all the crew to this deck, and cut off life\\nsupport everywhere else. Then we could divert all power to the deflector\\ndish. B'Elanna, re-establish the comm. link with the other ship.\\nJANEWAY 2 [on monitor]: This is Janeway. What have you decided?\\nJANEWAY 1: Captain, we think we can channel enough energy to our\\ndeflector dish to try the merging process.\\nJANEWAY 2 [on monitor]: Good. When can we start?\\nJANEWAY 1: We'll need at least fifteen minutes to make our preparations.\\nJANEWAY 2 [on monitor]: We'll be ready.\\nJANEWAY 1: And Captain, we'll only have enough power to try this once.\\nJANEWAY 2 [on monitor]: I understand.\\nJANEWAY 1: Chakotay, Tuvok, begin the evacuation process.\\nCHAKOTAY 1: Aye, Captain.\\nPARIS 1: I'll let the Doctor know he'll have to rely on his back up power\\nsupply.\\n\\nTORRES 1: We're ready, Captain.\\nJANEWAY 2 [on monitor]: We're standing by, Captain. I think you should\\ntake the lead in this operation since you may have to make allowances for\\nyour ship's weakened power systems.\\nJANEWAY 1: Acknowledged. Lieutenant Torres and, Lieutenant Torres, charge\\nthe deflector dishes.\\nTORRES 1: Deflector dish charging.\\n\\n[Voyager 2 - Engineering]\\n\\nTORRES 2: Capacitance levels are rising. Sixty percent, eighty five\\npercent, ninety eight percent. We're ready to create the subspace\\ndivergence field.\\n\\n[Voyager 1 - Engineering]\\n\\nTORRES 1: Initiating. Power flow nominal, Captain.\\nJANEWAY 1: Synchronise computer event timing. Ready to release\\ndepolarisation pulse on my mark. Now.\\nTORRES 1: The pulses have been emitted, Captain. The fields are starting\\nto depolarise.\\n\\n[Voyager 2 - Engineering]\\n\\nTORRES 2: But we aren't merging. In fact, we're going further out of\\nphase!\\n\\n[Voyager 1 - Engineering]\\n\\nJANEWAY 1: Increase power to the deflector dish.\\nTORRES 1: I can't! Too much plasma back flow. If we keep this up, we're\\ngoing to lose our antimatter connection. We'll both be destroyed!\\nJANEWAY 1: Abort!\\n\\n[Voyager 2 - Engineering]\\n\\nTORRES 2: Aborting resonance pulse.\\nJANEWAY 2: What went wrong?\\nTORRES 2: I'm not sure. I think the plasma flow became to turbulent. The\\ndivergence fields were so chaotic, we couldn't complete the merging.\\nWe've lost the comm. link as well. Captain, the antimatter leak? it's\\nbecoming a haemorrhage. If we don't start the proton bursts, we'll be\\ncompletely drained in thirty minutes.\\nJANEWAY 2: The lives of both crews are at stake here. I can't make\\nunilateral decisions that might affect that other ship. Janeway to Kim.\\nIs the spatial rift still stable?\\n\\n[Voyager 2 - Bridge]\\n\\nKIM 2: I think so, Captain. And I've rigged a phase discriminator. Kes\\nshould be able to go back safely.\\n\\n[Voyager 2 - Engineering]\\n\\nJANEWAY 2: Rig another one, Ensign. I'm going with her.\\n\\n[Voyager 2 - Turbolift]\\n\\nKIM 2: This should protect you from the spatial transition.\\n\\n[Voyager 2 - Corridor]\\n\\nJANEWAY 2: Keep trying to re-establish a comm. link between the ships.\\nTORRES 2: I will, but remember, we have fewer than thirty minutes of\\nantimatter left. Whatever you do over there, do it fast.\\nJANEWAY 2: Understood. Are you ready?\\nKES 1: Yes.\\n\\n[Voyager 1 - Corridor]\\n\\nKES 1: It's gotten worse here.\\nJANEWAY 2: Command Control is in Main Engineering. Let's go.\\n\\n[Voyager 1 - Engineering]\\n\\nTORRES 1: I don't know how else to stop the antimatter drain, except with\\nproton bursts.\\nJANEWAY 1: We can't do that. We'd damage the other ship just like this\\none. Think people. We need options.\\nJANEWAY 2: I agree, Captain. And I think we need to talk.\\n\\nJANEWAY 2: By my estimates, our antimatter supply will run out in less\\nthan half an hour.\\nJANEWAY 1: The attempt to merge our ships is throwing us further out of\\nphase. The quantum cohesion on both Voyagers is breaking down.\\nJANEWAY 2: Just like original Kent State experiment. The duplicate atoms\\ncouldn't occupy the same point in space-time for very long before\\nJANEWAY 1: Mutual annihilation.\\nJANEWAY 2: What are our options?\\nJANEWAY 1: Let's try a different tact. Instead of trying to merge the two\\nships, let's try to separate them. Maybe we could divide the antimatter\\nbetween us.\\nJANEWAY 2: I'm afraid not. We've been studying that theory. B'Elanna\\ntells me that any attempt to disrupt the antimatter supply will destroy\\nus all. What about evacuating your crew to my ship? It might get a little\\ncrowded, but we could manage.\\nJANEWAY 1: We've been studying that theory. And my B'Elanna tells me that\\nsending any more than five to ten people through the rift would radically\\nalter the atomic balance of the two Voyagers. We'd both be destroyed.\\nCaptain, I think you should return to your ship and run a metallurgical\\nanalysis. Find out the precise phase modulation of your hull. I'll do the\\nsame here. Maybe we can find a way to realign the phase displacement.\\nJANEWAY 2: You're going to self-destruct your ship.\\nJANEWAY 1: What makes you say that?\\nJANEWAY 2: Because that's what I would do if your Voyager were intact,\\nand my Voyager were crippled, my crew wounded or dead. I'd sacrifice my\\nship so that yours could survive.\\nJANEWAY 1: Then I'm glad we agree. Go back to your ship.\\nJANEWAY 2: I didn't say I agree, I said I understand. I'm not willing to\\nlet you make that sacrifice yet. We haven't explored all the options.\\nJANEWAY 1: Yes, we have and we both know it. This is my ship and my\\ndecision.\\nJANEWAY 2: Captain, I'm not going to let you.\\nJANEWAY 1: I've made my decision! Please don't make me call security and\\nhave you escorted off my ship, because you know I'll do it.\\nJANEWAY 2: All right. I'll go back. But give me fifteen minutes to come\\nup with another solution. After that, it's your decision.\\nJANEWAY 1: Fifteen minutes. Good luck.\\nJANEWAY 2: To both of us.\\n\\n[Voyager 2 - Bridge]\\n\\nKIM 2: Okay, I've managed to re-establish a comm. link with the other\\nVoyager.\\nJANEWAY 2: Hail them.\\nJANEWAY 2: Captain, I've got an idea. Actually, it was yours. It might be\\npossible to realign the phase displacement between us.\\nJANEWAY 1 [on viewscreen]: We don't have time to try it. May plan is the\\nonly one that's going to work. It's time that we both accept that.\\n\\n[Voyager 1 - Engineering]\\n\\nPARIS 1: We've got a perimeter alert. A vessel is approaching, bearing oh\\noh five mark three one eight. They've just dropped out of warp.\\nCHAKOTAY 1: Can you identify them?\\nPARIS 1: They're Vidiian, sir.\\n\\n[Voyager 2 - Bridge]\\n\\nJANEWAY 2: Red alert.\\n\\n[Voyager 1 - Engineering]\\n\\nJANEWAY 1: Shields.\\nCHAKOTAY 1: Still off-line.\\n\\n[Voyager 2 - Bridge]\\n\\nJANEWAY 1 [on viewscreen]: Captain, we're picking up a Vidiian ship\\nheading this way. Can you see them too?\\nJANEWAY 2: Yes.\\nJANEWAY 1 [on viewscreen]: Do you have any weapons?\\nJANEWAY 2: Stand by. Tuvok?\\nTUVOK 2: Negative, Captain. We had to reroute power to compensate for the\\nantimatter loss. It would take several hours to bring weapons back\\non-line.\\n\\n[Vidiian Ship]\\n\\nVIDIIAN COMMANDER: What is it?\\nVIDIIAN: Their ship seems to be trapped in some sort of spatial flux.\\nVIDIIAN COMMANDER: Have they detected us?\\nVIDIIAN: Yes. But they can't raise their shields. And it appears that\\nwhatever is happening to them has disrupted their weapon systems.\\nVIDIIAN COMMANDER: Load a hypothermic charge. Fire.\\n\\n[Voyager 1 - Engineering]\\n\\nTUVOK 1: Captain, they have fired an energy weapon.\\n\\n[Voyager 2 - Bridge]\\n\\nTuvok 2: All hands, brace for impact. Damage control teams, stand by.\\n\\n[Voyager 1 - Engineering]\\n\\nJANEWAY 1: What happened? They couldn't have missed.\\nCHAKOTAY 1: Maybe they hit the other Voyager.\\nJANEWAY 1: Hail them.\\nTORRES 1: I've lost the comm. link again.\\nJANEWAY 1: Try to get it back.\\n\\n[Vidiian Ship]\\n\\nVIDIIAN: We have destroyed their weapons array.\\nVIDIIAN COMMANDER: Manoeuvre us to within grappling range.\\n\\n[Voyager 2 - Bridge]\\n\\nTUVOK 2: They are cutting an access route through the hull on deck five.\\n\\n[Voyager 2 - Corridor]\\n\\nVIDIIAN: Vulcan. Male. The phaser blast damaged the right kidney, but the\\nother organs are healthy.\\nVIDIIAN COMMANDER: Begin with them.\\n\\n[Voyager 2 - Sickbay]\\n\\nEMH 2: I've erected an emergency force field around Sickbay. That should\\nhold them off for a while.\\nWILDMAN 2: I won't let them take my baby.\\nEMH 2: It's going to be all right, Ensign. Give her to me and I'll hide\\nher inside an access port. If they do break in, it's unlikely they'll\\nlook for anyone there. Trust me, Ensign. I won't let anyone touch our\\nbaby.\\nWILDMAN 2: Mama will see you soon.\\nEMH 2: Lieutenant, give me a hand. Move this. We're going to have to cut\\naway the internal circuitry to make room\\nKES 2: Vidiians. They're using some kind of disrupter to break down the\\nforce field. The force field's down.\\n\\n[Voyager 2 - Bridge]\\n\\nJANEWAY 2: Commander?\\nCHAKOTAY 2: They've got everything below deck five. And I don't know how\\nmuch longer we can keep them away from the Bridge.\\nJANEWAY 2: Mister Kim, how many Vidiians are there on the ship?\\nKIM 2: Three hundred and forty seven and more are boarding.\\nCHAKOTAY 2: We're outnumbered two to one.\\nKIM 2: I've got an incoming subspace signal. It's from the other Voyager.\\nThey must've re-established the comm. link.\\nJANEWAY 2: On screen.\\nJANEWAY 1 [on viewscreen]: Captain, this comm. link might not last much\\nlonger. What's happening over there?\\nJANEWAY 2: We've been boarded. The Vidiians are on the verge of taking\\nover our ship. Are they on yours?\\nJANEWAY 1 [on viewscreen]: No. We don't think they can detect our ship.\\nCaptain, we can have a security detachment cross the spatial rift and\\nboard your ship within five minutes.\\nJANEWAY 2: No. If we do that, the Vidiians might become aware of your\\nVoyager. That would put both ships at risk.\\nJANEWAY 1 [on viewscreen]: We can't just stand by and let you all be\\nkilled.\\nJANEWAY 2: I'm not about to let that happen. I'll destroy this ship.\\nJANEWAY 1 [on viewscreen]: I don't suppose there's any way I can change\\nyour mind. I know how stubborn you can be.\\nJANEWAY 2: True. But there is something else I can do for you. I'm going\\nto send Harry Kim through the rift with Ensign Wildman's baby. Somehow,\\nit seems only fair.\\nJANEWAY 1 [on viewscreen]: We'll be waiting for them.\\nJANEWAY 2: Just make me a promise, Kathryn. Get your crew home.\\nJANEWAY 1 [on viewscreen]: I will. I will!\\nJANEWAY 2: Harry, you've got five minutes. Get the baby.\\nKIM 2: But Captain.\\nJANEWAY 2: Move it, Ensign! That's an order! Computer, initiate the\\nself-destruct sequence. Authorisation Janeway Pi one one zero. Set at\\nfive minutes and mute voice warnings. Enable.\\nCOMPUTER: Warning. Self-destruct sequence has been initiated. Warp core\\noverload in four minutes, fifty five seconds. There will be no further\\naudio warnings.\\n\\n[Voyager 2 - Sickbay]\\n\\nVIDIIAN: Ocampa. Female. The organs are healthy. She has an extremely\\nhigh rate of tissue regeneration.\\nVIDIIAN SURGEON: Extract her pelvic ridge. We'll analyse the bone marrow\\nfor phage resistance. The others are human. My scans indicate their\\npancreatic tissues are well suited for transplant. Begin the extraction\\nprocedure.\\nVIDIIAN: This one. A female human. She's recently given birth.\\nVIDIIAN SURGEON: Are you certain?\\nVIDIIAN: Yes. Her hemo-uterine levels are far above normal.\\nVIDIIAN SURGEON: Where's the infant? Set your bio-probe to maximum. Find\\nit.\\nKIM 2: No!\\nEMH 2: Ensign Kim, is that you?\\nKIM 2: Doc, am I glad to see you.\\nEMH 2: Have we retaken the ship?\\nKIM 2: No. Actually, the Captain's put the ship on self-destruct. She\\nordered me to take the baby and go to the other Voyager.\\nEMH 2: Well, I, I guess you'd better hurry then.\\nKIM 2: Good bye, Doc.\\nEMH 2: Ensign. Tell my counterpart that I've corrected all signs of\\nhemocythemia. He'll know what that means.\\nKIM 2: Will do.\\n\\n[Voyager 2 - Bridge]\\n\\nJANEWAY 2: Hello. I'm Captain Kathryn Janeway. Welcome to the Bridge.\\nVIDIIAN: Commander!\\n\\n[on display screen] DESTRUCT SEQUENCE ENGAGED\\n\\n[Voyager 1 - Corridor]\\n\\nTORRES 1: Ah, it's about time.\\nTUVOK 1: Tuvok to Janeway. Ensign Kim has made it through the rift, with\\nthe infant.\\n\\n[Voyager 1 - Engineering]\\n\\nJANEWAY 1: Acknowledged.\\nCHAKOTAY 1: Captain, the Vidiian ship has been destroyed. So has the\\nother Voyager.\\n\\nCaptain's Log, Stardate 49548.7. There are no signs of any pursuing\\nVidiian vessels, and we have resumed a course toward home.\\n\\n[Sickbay]\\n\\nTUVOK: Repair efforts are underway. Lieutenant Torres estimates we'll be\\nable to return to the Bridge within three days.\\nJANEWAY: Good. I'm not sure how much longer B'Elanna can tolerate my\\nstanding over her shoulder in Engineering.\\nTUVOK: Hmm.\\nJANEWAY: Tuvok, is there something on your mind?\\nTUVOK: I am curious, Captain. Before the Vidiians attacked, when you were\\nin disagreement with the other Captain about\\nJANEWAY: Would I have given the order to self-destruct our ship? I've\\ngone over that moment a thousand times in my mind. The truth is, yes, I\\nwould have given the order. But I will admit, there was a part of me that\\ncould see her point of view.\\nTUVOK: One could say that you were both the doubter and the doubted. I do\\nnot envy the paradox of logic you were faced with in that situation.\\nJANEWAY: Neither did I. And neither did she.\\nWILDMAN: Thank you. Thank you so much.\\nKIM: You're welcome. But you should also thank the Doctor. It was his\\ncounterpart who saved her from the Vidiians.\\nEMH: I'm not surprised. I am programmed to be heroic when the need\\narises. By the way, Ensign, this other Doctor, did he have a name?\\nKIM: I really didn't have time to ask.\\nJANEWAY: Am I allowed to go back to my temporary bridge now, Doctor?\\nEMH: By all means.\\n\\n[Corridor]\\n\\nJANEWAY: It's good to have you back, Ensign.\\nKIM: Thank you, I think.\\nJANEWAY: Something wrong?\\nKIM: I'm not sure. I mean, this isn't really my ship, and you're not\\nreally my captain. And yet, you are and there's no difference. But I know\\nthere's a difference. Or is there? It's all a little weird.\\nJANEWAY: Mister Kim, we're Starfleet officers. Weird is part of the job.\\n\\n\\n\\nStar Trek ® is copyright of CBS Studios INC.

       "\"Title: Deadlock Stardate: 49548.7 Original Airdate: March 18 1996 [Mess Hall] NEELIX: Good afternoon, Ensign. How are we doing today? WILDMAN: Oh, we're doing just fine, thank you. NEELIX: Good, good. Er, by the way, I was wondering if you'd take a look at the thermal array in the kitchen. It overloaded this morning and vaporised an entire pot roast. WILDMAN: I'd be happy to. NEELIX: Wonderful. I informed Ensign Kim about the problem hours ago, and he still hasn't come down to fix it. WILDMAN: He's been working on a problem with the structural integrity grid. I'm sure he hasn't forgotten about you. NEELIX: If this thing doesn't get fixed soon, we'll all be eating cold leftovers for dinner and who do you think the crew will blame? WILDMAN: Looks like you need a new set of anodyne relays. I'll go down to Engineering and get some for you out of storage. NEELIX: Thanks. Oh, and er, while you're here, would you mind taking a look at the replicator? It's been having trouble making anything with large amounts of cellulose. WILDMAN: Of course. NEELIX: Cabbages, psyllium, green beans, celery and all. It all comes out looking a touch too yellow. WILDMAN: I thought you didn't use replicated vegetables when you're cooking. Always fresh, organic, from the airponic bay. NEELIX: Oh, well, the yields have been a little low lately. And normally, I would never dream of using synthesised veggies. WILDMAN: It looks like a malfunction in the power grid. Shouldn't be too difficult. NEELIX: What's wrong? WILDMAN: I think I'm having a contraction. Oh, yeah! It's a contraction, all right. NEELIX: That's wonderful. Labour can't be far behind. Let's, let's get you to Sickbay. Try to breathe now. Deep, deep regular breaths. Not so fast now. We're having a baby. [Sickbay] EMH: Push! KES: Don't forget to breathe, Samantha. Deep regular breaths. That's it. EMH: Cervical dilation is at ten point two centimetres. Prostaglandin levels are normal. Push, Ensign. WILDMAN: You push, damn it! I'm sick of pushing! EMH: I know you're fatigued. Try to focus on your breathing. Remember the exercises we did. When you feel a contraction, bear down. [Bridge] PARIS: This is ridiculous. It's been seven hours. How long does it take to deliver a baby? JANEWAY: As long as it takes, Mister Paris. TUVOK: Indeed. During the birth of our third child, my wife was in labour for ninety six hours. KIM: Four days? TUVOK: I have learned that pregnancy and patience go hand in hand. CHAKOTAY: You know, I didn't expect to be this nervous. It's not even my child. JANEWAY: In a way, this child belongs to all of us. It is the first baby born on Voyager. I'm just not sure whether I should be welcoming it on board, or apologising. CHAKOTAY: Captain? JANEWAY: Voyager isn't exactly anyone's idea of a nursery, and the Delta Quadrant isn't much of a playground. CHAKOTAY: My father had a saying, Captain. 'Home is wherever you happen to be.' TUVOK: Captain, long-range sensors are picking up heavy subspace communications ahead. They're Vidiian. JANEWAY: All stop. A ship? TUVOK: At least twenty ships within sensor range. I am also detecting a G-type star system with two inhabited planets. Life signs, Vidiian. CHAKOTAY: Sounds like we're headed right into their territory. JANEWAY: And I'm in no mood to donate any organs today. Options, Mister Paris? PARIS: There's a large plasma drift bearing forty mark seven. It extends almost half the length of this sector. Interference from the plasma should block us from their sensors. JANEWAY: Good thinking. Lay in a course at full impulse. Mister Tuvok, deflectors at maximum. [Sickbay] WILDMAN: Oh! Oh, what was that? EMH: What's wrong? WILDMAN: A pain in my abdomen. It's different. Sharp. Oh, God! EMH: The baby has shifted position, and its exo-cranial ridges have lodged in the uterine wall. This is a rare complication, but it's been known to happen in human-Ktarian pregnancies. KES: Can we reposition the baby? EMH: No. Its spinal column is too fragile. I don't want to risk nerve damage. If we don't deliver the baby now, its ridges could perforate the uterus and cause internal bleeding. Kes, prepare for a foetal transport. [Bridge] PARIS: We're clearing the Vidiian system, Captain. JANEWAY: Take us out of the plasma drift and resume our previous course. [Sickbay] EMH: I've locked onto the baby's co-ordinates. We're ready to begin. Initiating umbilical separation. Energising. Congratulations, Ensign. It's a girl. WILDMAN: Is she all right? EMH: The transport caused a slight hemocythemic imbalance, but we'll stabilise her cell membranes with osmotic pressure therapy. [Bridge] JANEWAY: What was that? KIM: We hit some kind of subspace turbulence as we were coming out of the plasma drift. I can't tell if PARIS: What the hell? Captain, the warp engines just stalled. JANEWAY: Go to impulse. PARIS: Impulse engines aren't responding. Manoeuvring thrusters are out too. KIM: We're losing main power. Switching to back up power. JANEWAY: Red alert. Bridge to Engineering. Report. [Engineering] TORRES: Our antimatter supply is being drained, Captain. I don't know why. The containment fields are in place. It's like we sprung a leak, but I can't find the crack. [Bridge] JANEWAY: B'Elanna, try infusing the warp core with repeated proton bursts. That should be enough to keep it going. [Engineering] TORRES: I think I can generate enough protons in the sensor array for a burst every thirty seconds. JANEWAY [OC]: Do it. TORRES: Hogan! These proton bursts are going to cause a lot of stress on the hull. Reinforce structural integrity to - now what? [Bridge] CHAKOTAY: What was that? TUVOK: It appeared to be a proton burst. JANEWAY: Already? Bridge to Torres. Report. Engineering, respond. KIM: Captain, three EPS conduits just ruptured in Engineering. They took heavy casualties. [Sickbay] EMH: The incubator is losing power. Activate the auxiliary respirator. CREWMAN: We've got wounded here. EMH: Second degree plasma burns on the face and neck. Treat him with a dermaline gel. CREWMAN: Yes, sir. EMH: Fractured clavicle, thoracic contusions, nothing serious. She can wait. Fused vertebrae. Prep him for surgery. Status? KES: It doesn't look good, Doctor. The baby's cell membranes won't stabilise. EMH: Increase the osmotic. That's not helping. Increase the osmotic pressure ratio by ten percent. KIM [OC]: Bridge to Sickbay, there's been a major coolant leak in the Mess Hall. You've got more wounded on the way. EMH: Acknowledged. [Engineering] TORRES: Torres to Bridge! We're definitely being, we're definitely being hit by proton bursts. But I don't know where they're coming from. I never even started the procedure. [Bridge] KIM: She's right. The main sensor array is off-line. Not a single burst was fired. JANEWAY: And yet the bursts appear to be originating from within the ship. It's like they're coming out of thin air. TUVOK: Captain, these burst are weakening the structural integrity of the hull. We cannot take any more. JANEWAY: Can we increase power to structural reinforcement? KIM: Our antimatter supply is too low. There's just not enough power to go TUVOK: Hull breach on deck fifteen, section twenty nine alpha. Emergency force fields are off-line. KIM: Captain, I've been working on a way to enhance our portable force field generators. It might be enough to seal that breach. JANEWAY: Go. [Sickbay] NEELIX: Don't you worry. We have the best doctor in the quadrant. KES: Doctor, her cell membranes are losing cohesion. EMH: Try remodulating the osmotic pressure. KES: No effect. EMH: Hang on. I'll be right there. Oh, no. [Corridor] KIM: Jefferies tube twelve runs right over the breach. If we can get close enough, we should be able to set up a portable containment field. HOGAN: The breach has weakened the integrity of that tube by twenty two percent. TORRES: That's why we need to reinforce the field. We'll use the power conduits on this deck. [Bridge] TUVOK: I've analysed the bursts on all spectral frequencies. There's still no indication of where they're coming from. JANEWAY: At this point, I don't give a damn where they're coming from. I just want to stop them. Chakotay, do we have enough auxiliary power to magnetise the hull? It might cushion the impact of the bursts. CHAKOTAY: We have just barely enough. JANEWAY: Give it a try. [Sickbay] EMH: I stabilised my imaging array but it could go out at any time. WILDMAN: Doctor? EMH: Prepare for emergency resuscitation. WILDMAN: My baby, she, she's going to die, isn't she? EMH: Not if I can help it. [Jefferies Tube] KIM: Here it is. The breach is directly below us. TORRES: Make it fast, Harry. Torres to Hogan. What's your status? [Corridor] HOGAN: Almost got it, Lieutenant. I'm rerouting all power in this section to your [Jefferies Tube] TORRES: Torres to Hogan. [Corridor] TORRES [OC]: Hogan, are you there? HOGAN: I'm hurt. [Jefferies Tube] TORRES: Harry. We have to help him. KIM: Just give me a minute. [Sickbay] EMH: Again. KES: Nothing. EMH: I'm sorry, Ensign. [Corridor] HOGAN: Hogan to Sickbay. I need medical assistance. Deck fifteen, section twenty nine. [Sickbay] KES: I'll go. [Jefferies Tube] TORRES: The breach is widening. Let's get out of here. Damn it, Harry! Let's go! KIM: Hold on. My minute isn't up yet. TORRES: Harry, grab my hand! Harry! [Corridor] KES: Lieutenant Hogan? TORRES: Kes, over here. Torres to Bridge. Ensign Kim is dead. [Bridge] TORRES [OC]: Kes just disappeared. JANEWAY: Disappeared? TORRES [OC]: I can't explain it. [Corridor] TORRES: She just vanished. There seems to be some kind of spatial rift. [Bridge] TORRES [OC]: Right where she disappeared. JANEWAY: Can you determine where it leads? [Corridor] TORRES: Stand by, Bridge. I just threw a piece of conduit into the rift. Just as it vanished, I detected another oxygen nitrogen atmosphere. [Bridge] JANEWAY: Another atmosphere? [Corridor] TORRES: Whatever's on the other side of that rift, there's air. Maybe Kes is still alive. [Bridge] JANEWAY: Get out of there, Torres! The hull breach is widening. I'm going to evacuate the entire deck. [Corridor] TORRES: You don't have to tell me twice. [Bridge] TUVOK: Main computer core is failing. Switching to back up processors. JANEWAY: Chakotay, are you ready to magnetise the hull? CHAKOTAY: Stand by. I'm having trouble with the alignment module. JANEWAY: Try remodulating the field emitters. Chakotay! CHAKOTAY: I've got alignment. Magnetising the hull. I think it worked. JANEWAY: Let's hope so. I want a full damage report from all decks. PARIS: Are you all right, Captain? JANEWAY: It's just a scratch. PARIS: It's more than a scratch. Maybe you should go to JANEWAY: I'm fine, Lieutenant. TUVOK: Damage reports are coming in. The hull breach on deck fifteen has widened to include deck fourteen, section twelve. And there are six hundred thirty two micro-fractures along the hull's infrastructure. All primary systems are off-line. We are running on emergency power only. The antimatter supply has dropped to eighteen percent and is continuing to fall. Warp coils in both nacelles have fused and are inoperative. The environmental control systems are failing. 15 crew members have been seriously wounded with plasma burns, twenty seven experienced other injuries. The Doctor is setting up triage facilities in Sickbay and Holodeck two. I must also regretfully report that Ensign Wildman's baby did not survive. JANEWAY: I want an engineering team to seal those micro-fractures before they become breaches. TUVOK: Aye, Captain. JANEWAY: Mister Paris, grab a medical tricorder and go assist the Doctor. PARIS: Right. JANEWAY: Commander, you have the Bridge. I'm going to go talk to Ensign Wildman. Maybe I can help. CHAKOTAY: The magnetic field is collapsing. The hull is depolarising! TUVOK: The fire suppression system is out. COMPUTER: Warning. Hull breach on deck one. Emergency force fields inoperative. CHAKOTAY: Everybody out! Go, go, go! Hurry, Captain! JANEWAY: I'm trying to reroute emergency power to the field emitters! CHAKOTAY: Captain! JANEWAY: I can seal this breach! CHAKOTAY: Captain, let's go! (Note to readers: damaged Voyager and crew will now be suffixed '1', while undamaged Voyager and crew will be suffixed '2'.) [Voyager 2 - Bridge] CHAKOTAY 2: Captain? JANEWAY 2: Ensign Kim, scan the Bridge. I just saw myself cross the Bridge and enter that turbolift. It was very faint, almost like a ghost image. And I looked like hell. KIM 2: Captain, there was a minor spatial fluctuation on the Bridge. But it was only there for a millisecond. JANEWAY 2: Bridge to Engineering. B'Elanna, how long until we can use the main sensor array? TORRES 2 [OC]: Another three hours. [Voyager 2 - Engineering] TORRES 2: We're only about halfway through the proton burst procedure. [Voyager 2 - Bridge] JANEWAY 2: See if you can speed up the process. We need the sensors as soon as possible. [Voyager 2 - Engineering] TORRES 2: Understood. [Voyager 2 - Bridge] JANEWAY 2: Mister Kim, modify a tricorder to scan for spatial anomalies. Go over every centimetre of this Bridge. Examine the sensor logs from our trip through the plasma drift. Look for anything unusual. I'll be in Sickbay. CHAKOTAY 2: Aye, Captain. [Voyager 2 - Sickbay] EMH 2: Good news, Ensign. Our baby is perfectly healthy. There's no sign of any interspecies abnormalities. WILDMAN 2: Our baby? EMH 2: A figure of speech. I am, in part, responsible for bringing her into the world. You may hold her now. WILDMAN 2: Hello there. JANEWAY 2: Congratulations, Samantha. She's adorable. Have you thought of a name? WILDMAN 2: Not yet. I really thought it would be a boy. JANEWAY 2: Let me know as soon as you decide. I've been making a blanket for her. All that's missing is an initial. Get some rest. How's our other patient doing? EMH 2: She's still unconscious. KES 2: I ran a microcellular scan. We're almost identical in every way. JANEWAY 2: Almost? EMH 2: There's a slight phase-shift in her DNA. Do you have any theory about where she came from? JANEWAY 2: Not yet. But I intend to find out. Can you wake her? EMH 2: I believe so. JANEWAY 2: Good, because I think she's going to have an interesting story to tell. KES 1: I was running through the corridor with my medkit. Deck 15. And then suddenly I felt dizzy, and my vision started to blur. After that, I don't remember anything, until you woke me up just now. KES 2: You were found unconscious down on Deck 15, holding a medkit. JANEWAY 2: We also found this lying next to you. It's a piece of damaged conduit. Our analysis shows it's from Voyager, Deck fifteen, section twenty nine alpha, bulkhead oh five two. But there's no damage to deck fifteen or anywhere else on this ship. KES 1: There was massive damage to deck fifteen. JANEWAY 2: The evidence would seem to suggest that you've come from a different ship, a different Voyager. We did find a spatial rift on deck fifteen. It's possible that it somehow connects us to this other Voyager. EMH 2: If you're right, where is the other ship? A parallel universe? Another dimension? Another point in time? JANEWAY 2: I'm not sure. Almost everything about the Voyager Kes described is identical to ours. We've had similar experiences, similar personal histories. We both entered a plasma cloud to avoid the Vidiians. Both of our engines stalled as we left the cloud, which caused both of our antimatter supplies to drain. And then we both decided to keep our engines running by emitting proton bursts. But after that, our experiences diverged. We started emitting the proton bursts. They didn't. KES 1: Our ship was being damaged by proton bursts. We couldn't figure out where they were coming from. JANEWAY 2: That's more than a coincidence. Janeway to Engineering. B'Elanna, I want you to stop the proton bursts immediately. [Voyager 2 - Engineering] TORRES 2: But if we stop now, the power levels will drop JANEWAY 2 [OC]: I'll explain later, Lieutenant. TORRES 2: Understood. [Voyager 2 - Sickbay] JANEWAY 2: I don't know how, but there's another Voyager out there, and I intend to find it. [Voyager 2 - Bridge] CHAKOTAY 2: We analysed the sensor logs from our trip through the plasma cloud. We couldn't find anything unusual until we ran a quantum-level analysis. Remember that subspace turbulence we hit just before we left the cloud? JANEWAY 2: Yes. CHAKOTAY 2: Well, watch what happens. KIM 2: At first, we thought it was a sensor aberration, but they were in perfect calibration at the time. TORRES 2: So I ran a multi-spectral analysis on the subspace turbulence. It was more than just turbulence. It was some kind of divergence field. And the moment we passed through it, all of our sensor readings doubled. Mass, energy output, bio- signatures, everything. Every particle of matter on this ship seems to have been duplicated in that instant. JANEWAY 2: So where is the other ship? KIM 2: As strange as it sounds, Captain, according to these readings, another Voyager's right here, right now, occupying the same point in space-time we are. JANEWAY 2: Quantum theorists at Kent State University ran an experiment in which a single particle of matter was duplicated using a divergence of subspace fields, a spatial scission. CHAKOTAY 2: If the same forces were at work inside the plasma cloud, they may have duplicated every particle of matter on Voyager. JANEWAY 2: Matter. But not antimatter. KIM 2: Captain? JANEWAY 2: In that Kent State experiment, they were able to duplicate normal matter. But when they tried to duplicate antimatter particles, the experiment failed. TORRES 2: So the antimatter on the ships wasn't duplicated. Both engines have been trying to draw power from a single source of antimatter. JANEWAY 2: Like Siamese twins linked at the chest, with only one heart. CHAKOTAY 2: So what do we do? JANEWAY 2: I don't know. But whatever it is, we're going to have to co-ordinate it with the other ship. Start working on a way to communicate with them. TORRES 2: Right. JANEWAY 2: The only link we know of is on deck fifteen, the spatial rift. We're going to need a way to send Kes back through safely. KIM 2: We could rig a portable phase discriminator. It might protect her from the spatial transition. JANEWAY 2: Get on it! [Voyager 2 - Sickbay] WILDMAN 2: When can I start breast feeding? EMH 2: Right away. However, I should forewarn you that her incisors will erupt within three to four weeks. Since your skin lacks the scales of a Ktarian, we'll have to discuss alternatives. WILDMAN 2: When can I take her home? EMH 2: In twenty four hours. I want observe the infant to make sure there's no more damage to her cell membranes. KES 2: You're welcome to stay the night so you may be with her. WILDMAN 2: I'd like that. Hey. [Kes 1's memory] EMH: Congratulations, Ensign. It's a girl. I've stabilised my imaging array, but it could go out at any rate. KES: Doctor, her cell membranes are losing cohesion. EMH: Try remodulating the osmotic pressure. KES: No effect. EMH: Again. KES: Nothing. WILDMAN: My baby. She's going to die, isn't she? EMH: I'm sorry, Ensign. WILDMAN: She's going to die, isn't she? [Sickbay] EMH 2: Kes. Kes! Are you all right? KES 1: Yes. It's just. The baby's crying, it was like a bad memory. EMH 2: What do you mean? KES 1: On my Voyager, during the delivery, there were complications. We performed a foetal transport. EMH 2: The same thing happened here. The transport was successful. KES 1: On my ship, the medical systems were heavily damaged. The osmotic pressure therapy didn't work. The baby died. EMH 2: I'm sorry to hear that. But try to understand, it wasn't your fault. The situation was out of your control. KES 1: Doctor, I've got to get back to my ship. They need my help. EMH 2: The Captain's working on it, Kes. In the meantime, try to get some rest. Besides, I'm sure your Voyager is also equipped with a proficient Emergency Medical Hologram. [Voyager 2 - Engineering] TORRES 2: It's a little harder to establish a comm. link than I thought, Captain. The molecular signature of the second Voyager is slightly out of phase with our own. I can't get visual, audio, nothing. JANEWAY 2: Have you tried remodulating the comm. frequency carrier? TORRES 2: Five times on forty seven different frequencies. JANEWAY 2: There has to be a way. If they were recalibrating their carrier wave at the same time so we could match phase variance, would that allow us to connect? TORRES 2: I think so, but in order to get them to do that, we'd have to communicate with them first. It's the chicken and the egg. JANEWAY 2: Maybe we need something a little more primitive. Is there a signal we could emit on all subspace bands just to get their attention? TORRES 2: A rotating band pulse might do it, but it wouldn't be much more than a shrill whistle. JANEWAY 2: That might be enough. Give it a try. [Voyager 1 - Engineering] TORRES 1: All right, Captain. All of the ship's command functions have been re-routed to Main Engineering. JANEWAY 1: Welcome to the new bridge. Now, let's see about. What's that? TORRES 1: I don't know. It's some kind of Conn emission coming through all subspace bands. JANEWAY 1: Coming from where? TORRES 1: Good question. I can't tell. But it's got a Federation signature. JANEWAY 1: Try recalibrating our frequency carrier to match it. [Voyager 2 - Engineering] TORRES 2: That's it! They recalibrated and locked onto our phase variant. JANEWAY 2: What kind of communication can we establish? TORRES 2: Not much at this point. We can use the emergency encryption code for a short message. Not more than five seconds. JANEWAY 2: That should be enough. [Voyager 1 - Engineering] JANEWAY 1: That's the emergency code. Run it through an alphanumeric sequencer. TORRES 1: I think someone's telling us to lock onto a frequency of twelve gigahertz. JANEWAY 1: Do it. TORRES 1: I'll try to clear it up. JANEWAY 2 [on monitor]: Captain, this isn't an illusion. What you're seeing is real, but it's going to take some explaining. CHAKOTAY 1: There are two Voyagers and two crews? JANEWAY 1: That's what I was told. TUVOK 1: Could this possibly be some kind of subterfuge, Captain? An alien deception? JANEWAY 1: That woman, whoever she is, had very specific knowledge of what happened here. The damage from the proton bursts, Wildman's baby, Kes disappearing. She even knew that when I was twelve years old, I walked home in a thunderstorm over seven kilometres because I lost a tennis match. TORRES 1: And her explanation of how the ship were duplicated, certainly plausible. PARIS 1: If it is true, what do we do about it? JANEWAY 1: My counterpart has suggested we try to merge the two ships. Recreate the subspace divergence field we passed through and then depolarise it. TORRES 1: Both ships would have to send out a massive resonance pulse from their deflector dishes at exactly the same time. CHAKOTAY 1: They may be able to do that, but we barely have enough power for life support. How can we get enough to send an energy pulse of that size? JANEWAY 1: We could evacuate all the crew to this deck, and cut off life support everywhere else. Then we could divert all power to the deflector dish. B'Elanna, re-establish the comm. link with the other ship. JANEWAY 2 [on monitor]: This is Janeway. What have you decided? JANEWAY 1: Captain, we think we can channel enough energy to our deflector dish to try the merging process. JANEWAY 2 [on monitor]: Good. When can we start? JANEWAY 1: We'll need at least fifteen minutes to make our preparations. JANEWAY 2 [on monitor]: We'll be ready. JANEWAY 1: And Captain, we'll only have enough power to try this once. JANEWAY 2 [on monitor]: I understand. JANEWAY 1: Chakotay, Tuvok, begin the evacuation process. CHAKOTAY 1: Aye, Captain. PARIS 1: I'll let the Doctor know he'll have to rely on his back up power supply. TORRES 1: We're ready, Captain. JANEWAY 2 [on monitor]: We're standing by, Captain. I think you should take the lead in this operation since you may have to make allowances for your ship's weakened power systems. JANEWAY 1: Acknowledged. Lieutenant Torres and, Lieutenant Torres, charge the deflector dishes. TORRES 1: Deflector dish charging. [Voyager 2 - Engineering] TORRES 2: Capacitance levels are rising. Sixty percent, eighty five percent, ninety eight percent. We're ready to create the subspace divergence field. [Voyager 1 - Engineering] TORRES 1: Initiating. Power flow nominal, Captain. JANEWAY 1: Synchronise computer event timing. Ready to release depolarisation pulse on my mark. Now. TORRES 1: The pulses have been emitted, Captain. The fields are starting to depolarise. [Voyager 2 - Engineering] TORRES 2: But we aren't merging. In fact, we're going further out of phase! [Voyager 1 - Engineering] JANEWAY 1: Increase power to the deflector dish. TORRES 1: I can't! Too much plasma back flow. If we keep this up, we're going to lose our antimatter connection. We'll both be destroyed! JANEWAY 1: Abort! [Voyager 2 - Engineering] TORRES 2: Aborting resonance pulse. JANEWAY 2: What went wrong? TORRES 2: I'm not sure. I think the plasma flow became to turbulent. The divergence fields were so chaotic, we couldn't complete the merging. We've lost the comm. link as well. Captain, the antimatter leak? it's becoming a haemorrhage. If we don't start the proton bursts, we'll be completely drained in thirty minutes. JANEWAY 2: The lives of both crews are at stake here. I can't make unilateral decisions that might affect that other ship. Janeway to Kim. Is the spatial rift still stable? [Voyager 2 - Bridge] KIM 2: I think so, Captain. And I've rigged a phase discriminator. Kes should be able to go back safely. [Voyager 2 - Engineering] JANEWAY 2: Rig another one, Ensign. I'm going with her. [Voyager 2 - Turbolift] KIM 2: This should protect you from the spatial transition. [Voyager 2 - Corridor] JANEWAY 2: Keep trying to re-establish a comm. link between the ships. TORRES 2: I will, but remember, we have fewer than thirty minutes of antimatter left. Whatever you do over there, do it fast. JANEWAY 2: Understood. Are you ready? KES 1: Yes. [Voyager 1 - Corridor] KES 1: It's gotten worse here. JANEWAY 2: Command Control is in Main Engineering. Let's go. [Voyager 1 - Engineering] TORRES 1: I don't know how else to stop the antimatter drain, except with proton bursts. JANEWAY 1: We can't do that. We'd damage the other ship just like this one. Think people. We need options. JANEWAY 2: I agree, Captain. And I think we need to talk. JANEWAY 2: By my estimates, our antimatter supply will run out in less than half an hour. JANEWAY 1: The attempt to merge our ships is throwing us further out of phase. The quantum cohesion on both Voyagers is breaking down. JANEWAY 2: Just like original Kent State experiment. The duplicate atoms couldn't occupy the same point in space-time for very long before JANEWAY 1: Mutual annihilation. JANEWAY 2: What are our options? JANEWAY 1: Let's try a different tact. Instead of trying to merge the two ships, let's try to separate them. Maybe we could divide the antimatter between us. JANEWAY 2: I'm afraid not. We've been studying that theory. B'Elanna tells me that any attempt to disrupt the antimatter supply will destroy us all. What about evacuating your crew to my ship? It might get a little crowded, but we could manage. JANEWAY 1: We've been studying that theory. And my B'Elanna tells me that sending any more than five to ten people through the rift would radically alter the atomic balance of the two Voyagers. We'd both be destroyed. Captain, I think you should return to your ship and run a metallurgical analysis. Find out the precise phase modulation of your hull. I'll do the same here. Maybe we can find a way to realign the phase displacement. JANEWAY 2: You're going to self-destruct your ship. JANEWAY 1: What makes you say that? JANEWAY 2: Because that's what I would do if your Voyager were intact, and my Voyager were crippled, my crew wounded or dead. I'd sacrifice my ship so that yours could survive. JANEWAY 1: Then I'm glad we agree. Go back to your ship. JANEWAY 2: I didn't say I agree, I said I understand. I'm not willing to let you make that sacrifice yet. We haven't explored all the options. JANEWAY 1: Yes, we have and we both know it. This is my ship and my decision. JANEWAY 2: Captain, I'm not going to let you. JANEWAY 1: I've made my decision! Please don't make me call security and have you escorted off my ship, because you know I'll do it. JANEWAY 2: All right. I'll go back. But give me fifteen minutes to come up with another solution. After that, it's your decision. JANEWAY 1: Fifteen minutes. Good luck. JANEWAY 2: To both of us. [Voyager 2 - Bridge] KIM 2: Okay, I've managed to re-establish a comm. link with the other Voyager. JANEWAY 2: Hail them. JANEWAY 2: Captain, I've got an idea. Actually, it was yours. It might be possible to realign the phase displacement between us. JANEWAY 1 [on viewscreen]: We don't have time to try it. May plan is the only one that's going to work. It's time that we both accept that. [Voyager 1 - Engineering] PARIS 1: We've got a perimeter alert. A vessel is approaching, bearing oh oh five mark three one eight. They've just dropped out of warp. CHAKOTAY 1: Can you identify them? PARIS 1: They're Vidiian, sir. [Voyager 2 - Bridge] JANEWAY 2: Red alert. [Voyager 1 - Engineering] JANEWAY 1: Shields. CHAKOTAY 1: Still off-line. [Voyager 2 - Bridge] JANEWAY 1 [on viewscreen]: Captain, we're picking up a Vidiian ship heading this way. Can you see them too? JANEWAY 2: Yes. JANEWAY 1 [on viewscreen]: Do you have any weapons? JANEWAY 2: Stand by. Tuvok? TUVOK 2: Negative, Captain. We had to reroute power to compensate for the antimatter loss. It would take several hours to bring weapons back on-line. [Vidiian Ship] VIDIIAN COMMANDER: What is it? VIDIIAN: Their ship seems to be trapped in some sort of spatial flux. VIDIIAN COMMANDER: Have they detected us? VIDIIAN: Yes. But they can't raise their shields. And it appears that whatever is happening to them has disrupted their weapon systems. VIDIIAN COMMANDER: Load a hypothermic charge. Fire. [Voyager 1 - Engineering] TUVOK 1: Captain, they have fired an energy weapon. [Voyager 2 - Bridge] Tuvok 2: All hands, brace for impact. Damage control teams, stand by. [Voyager 1 - Engineering] JANEWAY 1: What happened? They couldn't have missed. CHAKOTAY 1: Maybe they hit the other Voyager. JANEWAY 1: Hail them. TORRES 1: I've lost the comm. link again. JANEWAY 1: Try to get it back. [Vidiian Ship] VIDIIAN: We have destroyed their weapons array. VIDIIAN COMMANDER: Manoeuvre us to within grappling range. [Voyager 2 - Bridge] TUVOK 2: They are cutting an access route through the hull on deck five. [Voyager 2 - Corridor] VIDIIAN: Vulcan. Male. The phaser blast damaged the right kidney, but the other organs are healthy. VIDIIAN COMMANDER: Begin with them. [Voyager 2 - Sickbay] EMH 2: I've erected an emergency force field around Sickbay. That should hold them off for a while. WILDMAN 2: I won't let them take my baby. EMH 2: It's going to be all right, Ensign. Give her to me and I'll hide her inside an access port. If they do break in, it's unlikely they'll look for anyone there. Trust me, Ensign. I won't let anyone touch our baby. WILDMAN 2: Mama will see you soon. EMH 2: Lieutenant, give me a hand. Move this. We're going to have to cut away the internal circuitry to make room KES 2: Vidiians. They're using some kind of disrupter to break down the force field. The force field's down. [Voyager 2 - Bridge] JANEWAY 2: Commander? CHAKOTAY 2: They've got everything below deck five. And I don't know how much longer we can keep them away from the Bridge. JANEWAY 2: Mister Kim, how many Vidiians are there on the ship? KIM 2: Three hundred and forty seven and more are boarding. CHAKOTAY 2: We're outnumbered two to one. KIM 2: I've got an incoming subspace signal. It's from the other Voyager. They must've re-established the comm. link. JANEWAY 2: On screen. JANEWAY 1 [on viewscreen]: Captain, this comm. link might not last much longer. What's happening over there? JANEWAY 2: We've been boarded. The Vidiians are on the verge of taking over our ship. Are they on yours? JANEWAY 1 [on viewscreen]: No. We don't think they can detect our ship. Captain, we can have a security detachment cross the spatial rift and board your ship within five minutes. JANEWAY 2: No. If we do that, the Vidiians might become aware of your Voyager. That would put both ships at risk. JANEWAY 1 [on viewscreen]: We can't just stand by and let you all be killed. JANEWAY 2: I'm not about to let that happen. I'll destroy this ship. JANEWAY 1 [on viewscreen]: I don't suppose there's any way I can change your mind. I know how stubborn you can be. JANEWAY 2: True. But there is something else I can do for you. I'm going to send Harry Kim through the rift with Ensign Wildman's baby. Somehow, it seems only fair. JANEWAY 1 [on viewscreen]: We'll be waiting for them. JANEWAY 2: Just make me a promise, Kathryn. Get your crew home. JANEWAY 1 [on viewscreen]: I will. I will! JANEWAY 2: Harry, you've got five minutes. Get the baby. KIM 2: But Captain. JANEWAY 2: Move it, Ensign! That's an order! Computer, initiate the self-destruct sequence. Authorisation Janeway Pi one one zero. Set at five minutes and mute voice warnings. Enable. COMPUTER: Warning. Self-destruct sequence has been initiated. Warp core overload in four minutes, fifty five seconds. There will be no further audio warnings. [Voyager 2 - Sickbay] VIDIIAN: Ocampa. Female. The organs are healthy. She has an extremely high rate of tissue regeneration. VIDIIAN SURGEON: Extract her pelvic ridge. We'll analyse the bone marrow for phage resistance. The others are human. My scans indicate their pancreatic tissues are well suited for transplant. Begin the extraction procedure. VIDIIAN: This one. A female human. She's recently given birth. VIDIIAN SURGEON: Are you certain? VIDIIAN: Yes. Her hemo-uterine levels are far above normal. VIDIIAN SURGEON: Where's the infant? Set your bio-probe to maximum. Find it. KIM 2: No! EMH 2: Ensign Kim, is that you? KIM 2: Doc, am I glad to see you. EMH 2: Have we retaken the ship? KIM 2: No. Actually, the Captain's put the ship on self-destruct. She ordered me to take the baby and go to the other Voyager. EMH 2: Well, I, I guess you'd better hurry then. KIM 2: Good bye, Doc. EMH 2: Ensign. Tell my counterpart that I've corrected all signs of hemocythemia. He'll know what that means. KIM 2: Will do. [Voyager 2 - Bridge] JANEWAY 2: Hello. I'm Captain Kathryn Janeway. Welcome to the Bridge. VIDIIAN: Commander! [on display screen] DESTRUCT SEQUENCE ENGAGED [Voyager 1 - Corridor] TORRES 1: Ah, it's about time. TUVOK 1: Tuvok to Janeway. Ensign Kim has made it through the rift, with the infant. [Voyager 1 - Engineering] JANEWAY 1: Acknowledged. CHAKOTAY 1: Captain, the Vidiian ship has been destroyed. So has the other Voyager. Captain's Log, Stardate 49548.7. There are no signs of any pursuing Vidiian vessels, and we have resumed a course toward home. [Sickbay] TUVOK: Repair efforts are underway. Lieutenant Torres estimates we'll be able to return to the Bridge within three days. JANEWAY: Good. I'm not sure how much longer B'Elanna can tolerate my standing over her shoulder in Engineering. TUVOK: Hmm. JANEWAY: Tuvok, is there something on your mind? TUVOK: I am curious, Captain. Before the Vidiians attacked, when you were in disagreement with the other Captain about JANEWAY: Would I have given the order to self-destruct our ship? I've gone over that moment a thousand times in my mind. The truth is, yes, I would have given the order. But I will admit, there was a part of me that could see her point of view. TUVOK: One could say that you were both the doubter and the doubted. I do not envy the paradox of logic you were faced with in that situation. JANEWAY: Neither did I. And neither did she. WILDMAN: Thank you. Thank you so much. KIM: You're welcome. But you should also thank the Doctor. It was his counterpart who saved her from the Vidiians. EMH: I'm not surprised. I am programmed to be heroic when the need arises. By the way, Ensign, this other Doctor, did he have a name? KIM: I really didn't have time to ask. JANEWAY: Am I allowed to go back to my temporary bridge now, Doctor? EMH: By all means. [Corridor] JANEWAY: It's good to have you back, Ensign. KIM: Thank you, I think. JANEWAY: Something wrong? KIM: I'm not sure. I mean, this isn't really my ship, and you're not really my captain. And yet, you are and there's no difference. But I know there's a difference. Or is there? It's all a little weird. JANEWAY: Mister Kim, we're Starfleet officers. Weird is part of the job. Star Trek ® is copyright of CBS Studios INC.

       "\"Title: Assignment: Earth Stardate: Unknown Original Airdate: Mar 29, 1968 Captain's log. Using the lightspeed breakaway factor, the Enterprise has moved back through time to the twentieth century. We are now in extended orbit around Earth, using our ship's deflector shields to remain unobserved. Our mission, historical research. We are monitoring Earth communications to find out how our planet survived desperate problems in the year 1968. [Bridge] (The ship rocks as if being hit by something.) KIRK: Alert status. Force shields on maximum. Leslie, begin sensor scan. SPOCK [OC]: Transporter room to Captain. [Transporter room] KIRK [OC]: Kirk here. What's happening? SPOCK: It appears we have accidentally intercepted someone's transporter beam, Captain. [Bridge] SPOCK [OC]: It's incredibly powerful. KIRK: It's impossible. The twentieth century had no such [Transporter room] SPOCK: Captain, something is beaming aboard this vessel. [Bridge] KIRK: I'll be right there. [Transporter room] SPOCK: The beam is originating at least one thousand light years away. SCOTT: No transporter beam can reach that far, not even in our century. (Kirk enters.) KIRK: Something is shaking us apart. SCOTT: It's locked, it's locked our circuits wide open. (One of the transporter pads has activated.) KIRK: You're right. Something is beaming aboard. (It's a man in a dark suit, holding a black cat. He steps down from the platform and speaks calmly.) SEVEN: Why have you intercepted me? KIRK: Security. SECURITY [OC]: Security. KIRK: Transporter room, on the double. SECURITY [OC]: On our way, sir. SEVEN: Please identify yourselves. KIRK: This is the United Spaceship Enterprise. I'm Captain Kirk, commanding. SEVEN: (to the cat) Yes, I heard him, Isis. We're aboard a space vessel. From what planet? KIRK: Earth. SEVEN: That's impossible. In this time period, there weren't (notices Spock) Humans with a Vulcan? You're from the future, Captain. You're going to have to beam me down to Earth immediately. (Security arrive.) KIRK: Phasers on stun. SEVEN: Careful, Isis. All right. Captain Kirk. My name is Gary Seven. I am a human being from the twentieth century. I was on my way KIRK: Humans of the twentieth century do not go beaming around the galaxy, Mister Seven. SEVEN: I've been living on another planet far more advanced. I was beaming to Earth when you intercepted me. KIRK: The location of that planet? SEVEN: They wish their existence kept secret. Even in your time, it will remain unknown. SCOTT: It's impossible to hide a whole planet. SEVEN: Impossible for you, not for them. Captain Kirk, I am of this time period. You are not. You interfere with me with what I have to do there, and you'll change history. You'll destroy the Earth and probably yourselves, too. SPOCK: If what he says is true, Captain, every second we delay him could be dangerous. KIRK: And if he's lying? SEVEN: This is the most critical period in Earth's history. The planet I'm from wants to help Earth survive. KIRK: What if it turns out you're an invading alien from the future? SPOCK: A most difficult decision, Captain. KIRK: I can't beam you down without further proof one way or the other. Security confinement. SECURITY: This way, please. KIRK: Sickbay. MCCOY [OC]: McCoy here. (Seven attacks the security men. Spock neck-pinches him but is thrown off. MCCOY [OC]: Jim. Jim! Jim. What's going on there? (Kirk gets a phaser and stuns Seven as he starts to work the transporter controls.) MCCOY [OC]: Sickbay to transporter room. [McCoy's office] MCCOY: Jim, what's going on down there? [Transporter room] KIRK: Bones, check the prisoner you'll find in security confinement. I want a medical analysis fast. Is he or isn't he human? Captain's log, supplemental. A man in a twentieth century business suit. What is he? Not even Spock's Vulcan neck pinch could stop him. Without our phasers, he would have over powered all five of us. I find it difficult to believe the mysterious Mister Seven can be human, and yet, suppose he is? [Briefing room] (Spock is stroking the cat, who is purring.) KIRK: What do you make of the cat, Mister Spock? SPOCK: Quite a lovely animal, Captain. I find myself strangely drawn to it. KIRK: This is the captain. All science, engineering, and supervisory personnel, lock into the briefing room. Our next decision can be of enormous consequence, not only to us but to Earth's entire future. You've already been given as much information as we have. Please break in at any time with analysis of that information. Navigation report. CHEKOV [on monitor]: We have analysed the direction of his beam, sir. Our star maps show no habitable planets in that area of the galaxy. SPOCK: He did say his planet was hidden, Captain. KIRK: Engineering. SCOTT [on monitor]: Still unable to analyze it, sir. It was so powerful, it fused most of our recording circuits. Could have brought him back through great distances, could have brought him back through time. There's no way for us to know. KIRK: Mister Spock, historical report. SPOCK: Current Earth crises would fill a tape bank, Captain. There will be an important assassination today, an equally dangerous government coup in Asia, and, this could be highly critical, the launching of an orbital nuclear warhead platform by the United States countering a similar launch by other powers. KIRK: Weren't orbital nuclear devices one of this era's greatest problems? SPOCK: Most definitely. Once the sky was full of orbiting H-bombs, the slightest mistake could have brought one down by accident, setting off a nuclear holocaust. [McCoy's office] MCCOY: McCoy here. KIRK [OC]: Bones, hurry with that report. Join me in the briefing room with your analysis. MCCOY: Acknowledged. [Brig] (Seven tests the forcefield blocking the doorway. Then, behind the guard's back, he takes a pen from his pocket and turns it into a device that shuts the forcefield off. He also uses it to stop the guard from shooting him.) SEVEN: You're tired. Go to sleep. (The guard slides down the wall with a grin on his face as Seven makes his escape.) [Briefing room] MCCOY: Well, I must admit the sensor readings seem too good. Human readings, yes, but not a single physical flaw. Totally perfect body. KIRK: If an alien needed a body. SPOCK: He might be inclined to prepare a perfect one, Captain. But then again he may be telling the truth. KIRK: Gentlemen, I need proof. All you're telling me is that on the one hand he may be lying and on the other (The cat exits the room.) SECURITY [OC]: Security alert. All decks alert. The prisoner has escaped. All decks alert. KIRK: This is the Captain. Inform us UHURA [OC]: Bridge to Captain, transporter circuits show someone preparing to beam down. KIRK: Try to override. Shut it off! [Transporter room] (The cat arrives as Seven finishes setting the controls.) SEVEN: I know, Isis. But we'll be gone before they get here. (They beam away just as Kirk, McCoy and Spock dash into the room.) [Apartment - main room] (A display case full of glasses splits in two, revealing a massive safe door behind it. The locking wheel turns, the safe door opens and Gary Seven carrying Isis the cat walks out of a fog into the main room. The safe door shuts itself behind him and is hidden again behind the shelves of glasses. Seven goes to the window and looks down onto a street filled with people and traffic.) SEVEN: You're right, Isis. It is primitive. It's incredible that people can exist like this. At least we won't have to. Not for long. Computer on. (A bookcase swings open to reveal a black screen, circular monitor and control panel.) COMPUTER: (high-pitched staccato female) Computer on. SEVEN: Specify locations of agents two oh one and three four seven. COMPUTER: Identify self. SEVEN: Simply check my voice pattern. You'll find me listed as Supervisor one nine four. Code name Gary Seven. COMPUTER: Voice pattern matches, but I have no listing of a Gary Seven assigned this planet. SEVEN: Computer, I am a class one supervisor. You are ordered to override previous instructions and answer my questions. COMPUTER: I am a Beta Five computer capable of analytical decisions. Please confirm identity as supervisor by describing nature of agents and mission here. SEVEN: Computer, I caution you. I have little love for Beta Five snobbery. Override. All right. Agents are male and female, descendants of human ancestors taken from Earth approximately six thousand years ago. They're the product of generations of training for this mission. Problem. Earth technology and science have progressed faster than political and social knowledge. Purpose of mission. To prevent Earth's civilisation from destroying itself before it can mature into a peaceful society. COMPUTER: Incomplete but sufficient. Location of agents unreported for three days. SEVEN: Why didn't you say so in the first place? No, don't answer that. Simply begin search immediately. Recheck all news broadcasts, decode any government intercepted message COMPUTER: I am aware of proper search procedures, one nine four. [Transporter room] (There are no clouds at all over North and Central Africa, the Middle East and into the Indian subcontinent as the Enterprise orbits Earth. No green vegetation either.) SCOTT: We can estimate only within a thousand metres or so where he beamed down, Captain. KIRK: If we beam down, can you compare our position with his control setting? SCOTT: Aye. SPOCK: Following him down is a major risk, Captain. If we ourselves do anything that changes history KIRK: I'm aware of that. But I must know if he's lying, and we can't answer that sitting up here. Have ship's stores prepare the proper costumes. Stand by to beam us down. [Apartment -main room] COMPUTER: In response to nuclear warhead placed in suborbit by other major power, United States today launching suborbital platform with multi-warhead capacity. Purpose, to maintain balance of power. SEVEN: That's the same kind of nonsense that almost destroyed planet Omicron Four. COMPUTER: Analysis correct. Earth situation similar. Mission of agents two oh one and three four seven. Set malfunction on United States rocket. SEVEN: Progress of mission Has the rocket been set to malfunction? COMPUTER: Negative. No progress. SEVEN: How much time before launch? COMPUTER: Exactly one hour, twenty seven minutes, twelve seconds. SEVEN: Computer, record the following. Unless agents are found immediately, I must undertake their mission. [Street] (Kirk and Spock have managed to beam down in suits and overcoats (and woolly hat for Spock of course) KIRK: Scotty, lock in on our position. [Transporter room] KIRK [OC]: Lead us to him. SCOTT: Locked in. Proceed one nine five degrees true. [Apartment - office] (The computer is fabricating identity papers for Seven, as a Colonel with the CIA, a Lieutenant in the NYPD and a Colonel with the NSA. It has also produced a map of McKinley Rocket Base. Then a young woman in an orange and purple mini-dress lets herself into an adjoining room.) ROBERTA: Hello? Anybody here? Looks like your lucky day, Roberta. They can't dock you if they don't know you're late. (Seven comes in from the main room.) SEVEN: Where have you been? ROBERTA: Oh, the subway got stalled SEVEN: Where have you been for the past three days? ROBERTA: Now, wait a minute. Why should I tell you? Who are you, anyway? SEVEN: Where's three four seven? ROBERTA: With three four eight? SEVEN: Two oh one, code responses are not necessary. ROBERTA: Listen, friend, maybe I'd just better call the police right now. SEVEN: Sit down. ROBERTA: Who do you think you are? SEVEN: I said sit down. ROBERTA: Okay, I will. SEVEN: I'll say one thing for you. You play your role well. But that is no longer necessary. I'm Supervisor one nine four, code name Gary Seven. I need a complete report ROBERTA: Report. SEVEN: Yes, report. Everything you have done for the past three Earth days. (He gestures to the typewriter.) ROBERTA: Oh. Everything I've done? SEVEN: Everything you've done. ROBERTA: Well, okay. (puts a sheet of paper in it.) Well, let's see. SEVEN: Not with your fingers. (He flicks a switch on the side of the machine.) ROBERTA: Well, how do you expect me to type, with my nose? Did you see that? The machine typed everything I. It's typing everything I'm saying! Stop it. Stop it! Stop it! (He turns it off.) Okay. That does it. I quit! SEVEN: Wait a minute. ROBERTA: I'm quitting right now! SEVEN: You're not acting, are you? ROBERTA: Acting? I'm leaving. Goodbye. (Seven locks the door remotely with his pen.) Hey. Hey! (Seven activates a green cube on the desk.) SEVEN: Tie in to computer. COMPUTER: Computer on. SEVEN: Scan unidentified female present. COMPUTER: Roberta Lincoln. Human. Profession, secretary. Employed by three four seven and two oh one. Description. Age twenty, five feet seven inches, one hundred twenty pounds, hair presently tinted honey blonde. Although behaviour appears erratic, possesses high IQ. Birthmarks ROBERTA: Hey. COMPUTER: Small mole on left shoulder. Somewhat larger star-shaped mark on her ROBERTA: Hey, watch it! Okay, I'll bite. What is it? SEVEN: Miss Lincoln. Miss Lincoln, What kind of work did your employers say they were doing here? ROBERTA: Research for a new encyclopaedia? No? No. SEVEN: All right. You can go. Of course, if you do, you won't be helping your country. Unless you don't care about that. ROBERTA: Sure, I care. What do you think I am? SEVEN: I don't know, Miss Lincoln, what you are, not yet. All I know is that my incompetence has made you aware of very secret devices that are vital to the security of this nation. ROBERTA: Oh. Well, what are you guys around here, anyway? FBI? Some kind of government agents, huh? (The cat enters as he hands her one of his new IDs) CIA. Very groovy. SEVEN: Thank you, Isis. I'll be right in. (Isis leaves) It's a trained cat, Just like guard dogs, that kind of thing. ROBERTA: Yeah? SEVEN: Don't let anybody in here. I'll be busy. ROBERTA: Okay. [Street] (Outside the apartment building.) KIRK: Scotty, [Transporter room] KIRK [OC]: Triangulate on this location. SCOTT: Correlated. Readings indicate a greater altitude. Approximately thirty metres higher, sir. [Street] KIRK: Out. [Apartment - main room] COMPUTER: Occurrence, automobile accident. Location Highway nine four nine, ten miles north of McKinley Rocket Base. Agents three four seven and two oh one were killed instantly. SEVEN: That just doesn't make sense. For them to die in something as useless as an automobile accident. Are the facts verified? COMPUTER: Verified. Descriptions of bodies are exact. [Apartment building] (Kirk and Spock step out of the elevator by apartment 12A) KIRK: Go ahead, Scotty. SCOTT: Proceed five metres, two four seven degrees true. (They arrive outside 12B, and Kirk rings the doorbell.) [Apartment - office] SEVEN: Computer off. (Roberta answers the door to the office as the computer hides behind the bookcase again.) KIRK; Where's Mister Seven? ROBERTA: I don't know what you're talking about. Listen, you guys can't come in here. KIRK: Where's Mister Seven? [Apartment - main room] (Seven activates the safe-cum-transporter.) ROBERTA [OC]: You can't come in here. Now, get out. What do you think you're doing? This is a government office. (Seven picks up Isis and leaves.) [Apartment - office] ROBERTA: Neither one of you can come in here. KIRK: Where's Mister Seven? ROBERTA: This is against the rules. SPOCK: In here, Captain. (at door to main room) ROBERTA: What do you think you're doing? You want me to (picks up the telephone) Send the police. Eight Eleven East Sixty Eighth Street, apartment twelve B. KIRK: Give me the phone. [Apartment - main room] (Seven is setting the dial on the 'safe') ROBERTA [OC]: No, get your hands off of me, you big jerk! Who do you think you are? Let go! [Apartment - office] (There's a physical tussle going on between Kirk and Roberta.) ROBERTA: What do you think you're doing, you big jerk? What's the big idea? [Apartment - main room] ROBERTA [OC]: Mister Seven, help! Help! [Apartment - office] (Spock takes over from Kirk in manhandling Roberta.) ROBERTA: Let go of me! Stop it! Don't go in there! What's the big idea? Get your hands off of me! I mean it! (She pulls off his hat and sees his ears and eyebrows.) What are you? (Kirk blasts open the connecting door as Seven dematerialises and the safe shuts itself.) [McKinley Rocket Base] (Carrying Isis, Seven walks out of Assembly Area B-10 hangar - warning, liquid hydrogen - into the early morning sunshine. Or late afternoon. The shadows are fairly long. TANNOY: Attention. Stand by for launch area clearance. It is now sixty minutes to launch. T minus sixty and counting. (And the big white US rocket stands gleaming on its launch gantry.) [Apartment - main room] (Kirk finds the plans to the rocket base lying on the table.) [Apartment - office] KIRK: Where's Mister Seven? ROBERTA: I'm warning you, I've already called the police. KIRK: Plans to McKinley Rocket Base. [Apartment building corridor] POLICE 1: There it is, Charlie. Open up in there. Police. (Roberta manages to shout before Spock can get his hand over her mouth.) POLICE 1: Open up in there! It's the police! [Apartment - office] KIRK: Wide scan, Scotty. We'll be moving. Spock, in here. Spock! (They go into the main room and Roberta dashes to open the door to the police.) ROBERTA: In there! [Apartment - main room] KIRK: Now, Scotty! POLICE 1: What's going on here? [Transporter room] (Kirk, Spock and the two policemen are beamed up. Kirk and Spock dash off the transporter pad leaving the flat-foots standing, slack-jawed.) KIRK: Reverse and energise. POLICE 1: Charlie. (They are beamed back into the apartment, watched by Roberta.) [McKinley Rocket Base - launch control] TANNOY: Attention. It is now fifty minutes to launch. T minus fifty and counting. All systems clear. All systems clear. Standing by for inspection of launch pad. [Outside Launch Control] (Seven is standing next to launch director Cromwell's car.) LIPTON: (a security guard) You! Speak to you a moment? SEVEN: Yeah, sure, Sarge. (hands over his NSA ID) There it is. LIPTON: I'll have to confirm this, Colonel. SEVEN: All right. LIPTON: Just put the cat down and keep your hands at your side. SEVEN: All right. LIPTON: (into telephone) Give me security. Identification check. SEVEN: Be careful, lsis. Don't get stepped on. LIPTON: Yes, security? (Isis yowls, distracting the guard. Seven whips out his 'pen' and zaps the guard into immobility.) SEVEN: (into telephone) Security, this is Sergeant Lipton, and we're all straightened out down here. Right, thank you very much. Goodbye. All right, Sergeant. Now let's just turn right around. We're going to walk this way. You just sit right down right right there and have a little nap. (Grinning inanely, the guard sits on the ground by the building and goes to sleep.) TANNOY: Attention. It is now forty five minutes to launch. T minus forty five and counting. All systems clear. All systems clear. [Launch Control] TANNOY: Standby for inspection of launch pad. CROMWELL: Heading for the gantry. Sound alert. [Rocket gantry] TANNOY: Attention. First alert. First alert. Begin clearing gantry area. Clear launch pad. Safety group, clear launch pad. All systems continue to green. Repeat. All systems still green. Standing by for inspection of launch pad. (Cromwell gets into his car outside launch control and drives away. Remember, we last saw Seven by this car.) [Transporter room] SCOTT: There's an old-style weather satellite in orbit below us. If I could bounce off it, I could get some good views. I've got it. (An image of the rocket is on the wall monitor.) SCOTT: I could get even closer. If I could spot him, I could lock on and beam him up. SPOCK: Chances are he's out of sight inside the rocket gantry or at one of the control centres. KIRK: Launch is in forty minutes. Stand by to beam us down. Continue visual scan. [McKinley Rocket Base] TANNOY: Attention. Stand by for launch area clearance. Range safety verified. Launch director now en route to rocket gantry to confirm launch pad clear. Ground stations three, four and eleven, stand by for confirmation. Repeat. Standby for launch area clearance. (Cromwell and a couple of military men arrive in their cars at the base of the rocket.) CROMWELL: Hi, Jack. NESVIG: Mister Cromwell. CROMWELL: Launch director at gantry, beginning final check. TANNOY: Attention. It is now thirty five minutes to launch. T minus thirty five minutes and counting. (Cromwell's car boot opens, and Seven and Isis get out.) TANNOY: Canary Islands confirming they are go for the launch. All ground stations confirm go. (The three officials return to their cars.) NESVIG: Lock the elevator at the top, Lieutenant. Time to get out of here. TANNOY: Attention. Clear launch pad. Repeat. Clear launch pad and gantry. (The officials drive away. Seven and Isis are in the elevator heading for the top of the rocket.) [Outside Launch Control] (Lipton, the guard that Seven put to sleep, wakes up as Kirk and Spock beam in.) LIPTON: Freeze! One move and you've both had it. [Launch Control] SECURITY [OC]: Intruder alert. Intruder alert. Security to launch director. We have unidentified intruders. Males. A pair. Do you want to delay countdown? [Apartment - main room] (Roberta is talking to the green cube.) ROBERTA: All right, don't answer, but you can tell him I quit. You can tell him I promise not to tell anybody anything. He's safe, and you're safe, my little green friend. (the box flashes twice) Same to you. (She sits on the desk and accidentally knocks the 'desk pen' that controls the safe door. Intrigued, she investigates.) [McKinley Rocket Base] (A crowd is gathering a few miles away to watch the launch.) TANNOY: Attention. Twenty minutes to launch. T minus twenty minutes and counting. All systems continue green. Repeat. All systems still green. [Rocket Gantry] (Seven is lying along one of the girders supporting the rocket, at a control panel access. Isis is meowing instructions.) SEVEN: Yes, thank you. I know how to open it. (with his ubiquitous pen) I know there's not much time. (He starts fiddling with the wiring inside.) [Launch Control] (Two communicators and two phasers are on the launch controllers console. Lipton's boss is doing the interrogation.) NESVIG: These are all they were carrying. TANNOY: T minus fifteen minutes and counting. NESVIG: You've got a chance, and I'll offer it only this once. The slightest possible charges will be brought against you if you identify yourselves and tell us why you're here. TANNOY: To delay countdown. CROMWELL: No sign of trouble on my boards. Launch director, confirm status all systems. TANNOY: Control to launch director, confirming. Status board indicates all is well. Space flight conditions measure out as planned. CROMWELL: Continue countdown. TANNOY: No countdown delay. Repeat, no delay. All systems are green and go. All systems are go. [Rocket Gantry] TANNOY: T minus fourteen and counting. SEVEN: Meow? You are nervous, aren't you, doll? All right. I'm going as fast as I can. [Launch Control] TANNOY: T minus thirteen minutes and counting. Status board looks good. Stages look good. All systems go. Status board says go. [Transporter room] (Scott is continuing his visual search for Seven, and finally spots him at the top of the rocket.) SCOTT: Security, send two men up here right away. [Launch Control] TANNOY: T minus eight minutes and counting. All systems go. Status board go. [Apartment - main room] (Roberta's fiddling with the safe door finally makes it open.) ROBERTA: No! [Transporter room] SCOTT: Stand by. I'm going to beam him up. (On the gantry, Seven feels the transporter effect and sits up, holding Isis. In the apartment, Roberta fiddles with knobs on the inside of the safe door and pulls him away from the Enterprise.) SCOTT: I had him and something yanked him away. [Apartment - main room] (Seven gets up from the floor of the safe.) SEVEN: What are you doing? I wasn't finished. ROBERTA: I'm sorry. I just touched that button right there and then wow! SEVEN: You must have intercepted the Enterprise trying to beam me on board. Computer on. (The bookcase opens up.) SEVEN: Lock into launch site scan. COMPUTER: One minute to launch. ROBERTA: Oh, my gosh! Captain's log, supplemental. Spock and I in custody. Even if we talked, they wouldn't believe us. We're powerless to stop Mister Seven or prevent the launch, or even be certain if we should. I have never felt so helpless. [Apartment - main room] COMPUTER: Thirty seconds to launch. ROBERTA: Look, hey, I mean, not even the CIA could do all this. [Launch Control] TANNOY: T minus twenty seconds. Mark. Stages reporting ready for launch. Automatic sequences on. She's completely automatic now. [Apartment - main room] COMPUTER: Fifteen seconds to launch. Ten seconds. [Launch Control] TANNOY: Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Ignition. We have ignition. (NASA footage of the powerful rocket lifting off and being tracked by radio telescopes.) TANNOY: Altitude one thousand feet. All good. All as planned. Trajectory nominal. [Apartment - main room] COMPUTER: Rocket passing twenty mile arc and accelerating. SEVEN: Computer, adjustments at the rocket base were not completed. Can I still take over the rocket as planned? COMPUTER: Rocket control possible with exceiver circuits operated manually. SEVEN: Exceiver on manual. Lock into flight telemetry. Visual off. (Roberta backs away and picks up the telephone. Isis meows a warning and Seven uses his pen to sever the cord.) SEVEN: Roberta, please don't try to leave. You'll find all the doors locked. Are you jealous, Isis? It's most unbecoming. COMPUTER: Rocket altitude now one hundred miles. Standing by to begin malfunction as planned. SEVEN: Begin malfunction at third stage. COMPUTER: Exceiver setting now nine zero point zero eight. SEVEN: Nine zero point zero eight. COMPUTER: Second stage ready to detach. SEVEN: Visual on. COMPUTER: Second stage detaching. (The famous shot of a rocket stage falling away back to Earth.) COMPUTER: Third stage igniting. SEVEN: Begin malfunction. Take it off course. COMPUTER: Malfunction setting correct. Rocket veering from planned course. [Launch Control] CROMWELL: Give me the readings fast. NESVIG: What is it? CROMWELL: Malfunction. Rocket is deviating from programmed flight path. TANNOY: Safety, standby to destruct. Continuing deviation from flight path. Repeat, deviation confirmed and increasing. Telemetry control transmitter systems tie in. All systems tie in. Report. [Apartment - main room] SEVEN: Arm the warhead. COMPUTER: Accomplished. Nuclear warhead now armed. Set exceiver nine one point two one eight. (Roberta picks up a cigar box.) SEVEN: Exceiver nine one point two one eight. [Bridge] (Uhura is scanning broadcasts in different languages.) SCOTT [OC]: Scott here. CHEKOV: Sensor shows that the rocket has armed itself, Mister Scott. SULU: Computers indicate an impact somewhere in the heart of the Euro-Asian continent. CHEKOV: We've still time to enter close orbit and destroy it with our phaser, sir. UHURA: They're beginning to worry on Earth, Mister Scott. [Transporter room] UHURA [OC]: I'm getting military alerts from the major powers. SCOTT: I've got to risk calling the captain. Lieutenant Uhura, open a channel. [Bridge] UHURA: Aye, aye. [Launch Control] TANNOY: Warhead status confirmed. She's armed herself somehow. Repeat. This bird is armed. The warhead's alive. All boards report status. Stand by on destruct. Standby to transmit destruct signal. NESVIG: How could the warhead arm itself? CROMWELL: We don't know. NESVIG: You can destroy it, of course. CROMWELL: If we can't, we're going to lay an H bomb on somebody somewhere. Ready on destruct signal. Destruct. TANNOY: Transmit destruct signal. Transmit destruct signal. (Kirk picks up a communicator, but Lipton hears the chirp as he opens it.) LIPTON: Get back over there. [Apartment - main room] (Roberta hits Seven over the head with the cigar box.) ROBERTA: Look, I'm sorry, but like you asked me, I do care about my country, and you can't be CIA. (She takes his pen from his pocket.) COMPUTER: Orbital platform separating. ROBERTA: Hold it! SEVEN: Computer, rocket status. ROBERTA: Hold it, Mister Seven. I'm telling you, you're through monkeying around with my country's rocket. COMPUTER: Warhead still armed. Six minutes to impact. ROBERTA: Hold it! Don't move! You did enough already! SEVEN: You've got to let me finish what I started, or in six minutes World War Three begins. COMPUTER: Flight path continuing on target. [Launch Control] TANNOY: Destruct is fouled up somehow, flight control. She's coming down fully armed. She'll go off on impact. CROMWELL: What? Try again! Boost the signal! TANNOY: Boosting signal. Boosting signal. Flight control, we have boosted destruct signal. Repeat. Destruct signal at maximum boost. SCOTT [OC]: (over the open communicator) Captain, can you read me? I was beaming up Mister Seven, and something yanked him away from me. LIPTON: Hello? Hello, come in. SPOCK: Here, let me help you, Sergeant. It's operated with this dial here. (Neck pinches Lipton and Kirk gets to the communicator.) TANNOY: We're getting no response. CROMWELL: Make absolutely certain. Check everything again. TANNOY: Tracking stations report no response on destruct signal. KIRK: Scotty, beam us directly to Seven's apartment. TANNOY: Auxiliary transmitters check out flight control. She hasn't destructed herself. Repeat. Destruct is not working. She's still up there. Do you read? Descending and armed. Descending and armed. She'll go off on impact. Bermuda ground station reports she's still up there. South Africa ground station reports no response on boosted destruct signal. CROMWELL: (picks up the red telephone) Get me the president. [Apartment - main room] COMPUTER: Rocket descending and accelerating. Do you have further instructions, one nine four? SEVEN: Roberta, you've got to believe me. Look, a truly advanced planet wouldn't use force. They wouldn't come here in strange alien forms. The best of all possible methods would be to take human beings to their world, train them for generations until they're needed here. ROBERTA: Mister Seven, I want to believe you. I do. I know this world needs help. That's why some of my generation are kind of crazy and rebels, you know. We wonder if we're going to be alive when we're thirty. COMPUTER: Two minutes to impact. KIRK: Hold it right there, Mister Seven. ROBERTA: Oh, no. KIRK: Spock, you're the expert. Can you detonate the warhead from this computer? SPOCK: I can try, Captain. COMPUTER: Altitude five hundred fifty miles. SEVEN: Captain, I want that warhead detonated, too. Unless I do it at least a hundred miles above ground, just barely in time to frighten them out of this arms race SCOTT [OC]: Captain, monitors show all major powers on full missile alert. Retaliatory strike ordered on warhead impact. COMPUTER: Altitude four hundred and fifty miles. KIRK: Spock. SPOCK: I can estimate some of this, Captain, but without more time SEVEN: Captain, he can only guess. Will you please let me do my job. KIRK: I don't know what your job is! You may set those controls so we can't detonate that warhead. ROBERTA: (pointing the pen at Kirk) Listen you, get away from him. SEVEN: (grabbing the pen from her) Roberta, be careful. The servo is set to kill. (He hands the pen to Kirk.) COMPUTER: Altitude four hundred miles. SEVEN: There are only seconds. I'll need time to set it. ROBERTA: Please. He's telling the truth. COMPUTER: Fifty five seconds to impact. KIRK: Spock, if you can't handle it, I'm going to have to trust him. SPOCK: It is difficult to know which is best, Captain. COMPUTER: Forty seconds to impact. SPOCK: Without facts, the decision cannot be made logically. You must rely on your human intuition. COMPUTER: Altitude three hundred miles. Descending and accelerating. KIRK: Go. COMPUTER: Thirty seconds and accelerating. SEVEN: Computer, go to visual. Count by tens. COMPUTER: One hundred ninety miles. One hundred eighty miles. One hundred seventy miles. One hundred sixty miles. One hundred fifty, one hundred forty, one hundred thirty, one hundred twenty. (there's a bright flash) Detonation one hundred four miles. (Big sighs of relief all round.) (Later, Gary Seven is dictating his report to the special typewriter. Kirk and Spock are back in uniform.) SEVEN: And in spite of the accidental interference with history by the Earth ship from the future, the mission was completed. SPOCK: Correction, Mister Seven. It appears we did not interfere. The Enterprise was part of what was supposed to happen on this day in 1968. (Suddenly Isis has transformed from a black cat to a dark haired woman in a black outfit.) KIRK: Our record tapes show, although not generally revealed, that on this date, a malfunctioning suborbital warhead was exploded exactly one hundred and four miles above the Earth. SEVEN: So everything happened the way it was supposed to. SPOCK: And you'll be pleased our records show that it resulted in a new and stronger international agreement against the use of such weapons. ROBERTA: Would you mind telling me who that is? SEVEN: That, Miss Lincoln, is simply my cat. ROBERTA: Your cat? (She's a cat again, who decides to scratch behind her own ear.) SEVEN: What else do your record tapes show? KIRK: I'm afraid we can't reveal everything we know, Mister Seven. SPOCK: Captain, we could say that Mister Seven and Miss Lincoln have some interesting experiences in store for them. KIRK: Yes, I think we could say that. Two to beam up, Scotty. SPOCK: Live long and prosper, Mister Seven. KIRK: And the same to you, Miss Lincoln. Energise. Star Trek ® is copyright of CBS Studios INC.

       "\"Title: The Cage Stardate: Unknown Airdate: 1988-10-04 [Bridge] SPOCK: Check the circuit. TYLER: All operating, sir. SPOCK: It can't be the screen then. Definitely something out there, Captain, headed this way. TYLER: It could be these meteorites. ONE: No, it's something else. There's still something out there. TYLER: It's coming at the speed of light, collision course. The meteorite beam has not deflected it, Captain. ONE: Evasive manoeuvres, sir? PIKE: Steady as we go. GARISON: It's a radio wave, sir. We're passing through an old-style distress signal. PIKE: They were keyed to cause interference and attract attention this way. GARISON: A ship in trouble making a forced landing, sir. That's it. No other message. TYLER: I have a fix. It comes from the Talos star group. ONE: We've no ships or Earth colonies that far out. SPOCK: Their call letters check with a survey expedition. SS Columbia. It disappeared in that region approximately eighteen years ago. TYLER: It would take that long for a radio beam to travel from there to here. SPOCK: Records show the Talos group has never been explored. Solar system similar to Earth, eleven planets. Number four seems to be Class M, oxygen atmosphere. ONE: Then they could still be alive, even after eighteen years. PIKE: If they survived the crash. SPOCK: We aren't going to go, to be certain? PIKE: Not without any indication of survivors, no. Continue to the Vega Colony and take care of our own sick and injured first. You have the helm. Maintain present course. ONE: Yes, sir. [Pike's quarters] BOYCE [OC}: Boyce here. PIKE: Drop by my cabin, Doctor. (Boyce enters with bag) What's that? I didn't say there's anything wrong with me. BOYCE: I understand we picked up a distress signal. PIKE: That's right. Unless we get anything more positive on it, it seems to me the condition of our own crew takes precedent. I'd like to log the ship's doctor's opinion, too. BOYCE: Oh, I concur with yours, definitely. PIKE: Good. I'm glad you do, because we're going to stop first at the Vega Colony and replace anybody who needs hospitalisation and also. What the devil are you putting in there, ice? BOYCE: Who wants a warm martini? PIKE: What makes you think I need one? BOYCE: Sometimes a man'll tell his bartender things he'll never tell his doctor. What's been on your mind, Chris, the fight on Rigel Seven? PIKE: Shouldn't it be? My only yeoman and two others dead, seven injured. BOYCE: Was there anything you personally could have done to prevent it? PIKE: Oh, I should have smelled trouble when I saw the swords and the armour. Instead of that, I let myself get trapped in that deserted fortress and attacked by one of their warriors. BOYCE: Chris, you set standards for yourself no one could meet. You treat everyone on board like a human being except yourself, and now you're tired and you PIKE: You bet I'm tired. You bet. I'm tired of being responsible for two hundred and three lives. I'm tired of deciding which mission is too risky and which isn't, and who's going on the landing party and who doesn't, and who lives and who dies. Boy, I've had it, Phil. BOYCE: To the point of finally taking my advice, a rest leave? PIKE: To the point of considering resigning. BOYCE: And do what? PIKE: Well, for one thing, go home. Nice little town with fifty miles of parkland around it. Remember I told you I had two horses, and we used to take some food and ride out all day. BOYCE: Ah, that sounds exciting. Ride out with a picnic lunch every day. PIKE: I said that's one place I might go. I might go into business on Regulus or on the Orion colony. BOYCE: You, an Orion trader, dealing in green animal women, slaves? PIKE: The point is this isn't the only life available. There's a whole galaxy of things to choose from. BOYCE: Not for you. A man either lives life as it happens to him, meets it head-on, and licks it, or he turns his back on it and starts to wither away. PIKE: Now you're beginning to talk like a doctor, bartender. BOYCE: Take your choice. We both get the same two kinds of customers. The living and the dying. SPOCK [on monitor]: Mister Spock here. We're intercepting a follow-up message, sir. There are crash survivors on Talos. [Bridge] GARISON: (reads) Eleven survivors from crash. Gravity and oxygen within limits. Food and water obtainable, but unless. The message faded at that point, sir. PIKE: Address intercraft. TYLER: System open. PIKE: This is the captain. Our destination is the Talos star group. Our time warp, factor seven. TYLER: Course computed and on the screen. ONE: All decks have acknowledged, sir. PIKE : Engage. TYLER: On course, sir. (Colt enters. Pike turns around and bumps into her) PIKE: Yeoman. COLT: Yes, sir. PIKE: I thought I told you that when I'm on the bridge COLT: But you wanted the reports by oh five hundred. It's oh five hundred now, sir. PIKE: Oh, I see. Thank you. ONE: She's replacing your former yeoman, sir. PIKE: She does a good job, all right. It's just that I can't get used to having a woman on the bridge. No offence, Lieutenant. You're different, of course. (The Enterprise arrives at a planet) TYLER: We've settled into orbit, sir. GEOLOGIST: Geological lab report complete, Captain. SPOCK: Preliminary lab survey ready, sir. PIKE: Spectography? GEOLOGIST: Our reading shows an oxygen nitrogen atmosphere, sir, heavy with inert elements but well within safety limits. PIKE: Gravity? GEOLOGIST: Zero point nine of Earth. TYLER: Captain? Reflections, sir, from the planet's surface. As I read it, they polarise out as rounded metal bits. Could be parts of a spaceship hull. PIKE: Prep a landing party of six. You feel up to it? SPOCK: Yes, sir. TYLER: Yes, sir. PIKE: Sorry, Number One. With little information on this planet, we'll have to leave the ship's most experienced officer here covering us. ONE: Of course, sir. [Transporter room] PIKE: There's no indication of problems down there, but let's not take chances. PITCAIRN: Yes, sir. There's a canyon to the left. We can set you there completely unobserved. [Planet surface] (the group explores until they find a rough settlement) GARISON: Sir. OLD MAN: They're men. They're humans. PIKE: Captain Christopher Pike, United Space Ship Enterprise. HASKINS: Doctor Theodore Haskins, American Continent lnstitute. SURVIVOR: Is Earth all right? PIKE: The same old Earth, and you'll see it very soon. TYLER: And you won't believe how fast you can get back. Well the time barrier's been broken. Our new ships can (He's struck dumb by the sight of a lovely young woman) HASKINS: This is Vina. Her parents are dead. She was born almost as we crashed. (The reunion is being watched on another screen, by three people with big bald heads) PIKE: (as the survivors pack up the settlement) Enterprise. ONE [OC]: Landing party, come in. PIKE: We'll begin transporting the survivors and their effects up to you very shortly. ONE [OC]: Quarters are being prepared, sir. Have I permission to send out scouting and scientific parties now? PIKE: That's affirmative on the VINA: You appear to be healthy and intelligent, Captain. A prime specimen. ONE [OC]: I didn't get that last message, Captain. PIKE: Er, affirmative on request. Landing party out. HASKINS: You must forgive her choice of words, Captain. She's lived her whole life with a collection of aging scientists. BOYCE: If they can spare you a moment, I'd like to make my medical report. VINA: I think it's time to show the Captain our secret. BOYCE: Their health is excellent. Almost too good. HASKINS: There's a reason for our condition, but we've had some doubt if Earth is ready to learn the secret. Let the girl show you. We'll accept your judgment. (Pike follows Vina up a slope to a ledge by a rock face) VINA: You're tired, but don't worry. You'll feel much better soon. Don't you see it? Here and here. PIKE: I don't understand. VINA: You will. You're a perfect choice. (Vina vanishes, and so do all the survivors and their encampment. A door opens in the rock face, Pike is knocked out and taken inside. At the settlement -) TYLER: Captain! (Everyone rushes over in time to see the door closing in the rock. They fire their phasers at it but it just blasts away the rock covering to show the metal underneath.) SPOCK: Spock here. ONE [OC]: Landing party, come in. SPOCK: There is no survivors' encampment, Number One. This is all some sort of trap. We've lost the Captain. Do you read? [Pike's cage] (Pike wakes to find himself in a cell with a transparent wall blocking his escape. He tests it's strength, and notices other similar occupied cells. There's a fanged ape, a giant bird and other scary shadows. The three aliens arrive) PIKE: Can you hear me? My name is Christopher Pike, commander of the space vehicle Enterprise from a stellar group at the other end of this galaxy. Our intentions are peaceful. Can you understand me? (the aliens communicate with their minds, not voices) TALOSIAN: It appears, Magistrate, that the intelligence of the specimen is shockingly limited. MAGISTRATE: This is no surprise since his vessel was baited here so easily with a simulated message. As you can read in its thoughts, it is only now beginning to suspect that the survivors and encampment were a simple illusion we placed in their minds. PIKE: You're not speaking, yet I can hear you. MAGISTRATE: You will note the confusion as it reads our thought transmissions. PIKE: All right then, telepathy. You can read my mind. I can read yours. Now, unless you want my ship to consider capturing me an unfriendly act MAGISTRATE: You now see the primitive fear threat reaction. The specimen is about to boast of his strength, the weaponry of his vessel, and so on. Next, frustrated into a need to display physical prowess, the creature will throw himself against the transparency. PIKE: If you were in here, wouldn't you test the strength of these walls, too? There's a way out of any cage, and I'll find it. MAGISTRATE: Despite its frustration, the creature appears more adaptable than our specimens from other planets. We can soon begin the experiment. [Briefing room] SPOCK: The inhabitants of this planet must live deep underground, and probably manufacture food and other needs down there. Our tests indicate the planet surface, without considerably more vegetation or some animals, simply too barren to support life. ONE: So we just thought we saw survivors there, Mister Spock. SPOCK: Exactly. An illusion placed in our minds by this planet's inhabitants. BOYCE: It was a perfect illusion. They had us seeing just what we wanted to see, human beings who'd survived with dignity and bravery, everything entirely logical, right down to the building of the camp, the tattered clothing, everything. Now let's be sure we understand the danger of this. The inhabitants of this planet can read our minds. They can create illusions out of a person's own thoughts, memories, and experiences, even out of a person's own desires. Illusions just as real and solid as this table top and just as impossible to ignore. ONE: Any estimate what they might want one of us for? SPOCK: They may simply be studying the Captain, to find out how Earth people are put together. Or it could be something more. TYLER: Then why aren't we doing anything? That entry may have stood up against hand lasers, but we can transmit the ship's power against it. Enough to blast half a continent. SPOCK: Look. Brains three times the size of ours. If we start buzzing about down there, we're liable to find their mental power is so great they could reach out and swat this ship as though it were a fly. TYLER: It's Captain Pike they've got. He needs help, and he probably needs it fast. ONE: Engineering deck will rig to transmit ship's power. We'll try blasting through that metal. [Talosian monitoring room] (As Pike continues to explore his cell) TALOSIAN: Thousands of us are already probing the creature's thoughts, Magistrate. We find excellent memory capacity. MAGISTRATE: I read most strongly a recent death struggle in which it fought to protect its life. We will begin with this, giving the specimen something more interesting to protect. [Rigel Seven] VINA: Come on, we must hide ourselves. Come, come. Hurry. It's deserted. There'll be weapons and perhaps food. PIKE: This is Rigel Seven. VINA: Please, we must hide ourselves. PIKE: I was in a cage, a cell, in some kind of a zoo. I must still be there. VINA: Come on. PIKE: They've reached into my mind and taken the memory of somewhere I've been. VINA: The killer! PIKE: It's starting just as it happened two weeks ago. Except for you. [Fortress] (The courtyard is scattered with lances and spears) PIKE: Longer hair, different dress, but it is you, the one the survivors called Vina. Or rather the image of Vina. But why you again? Why didn't they create a different girl? (The killer enters - a big humanoid with shield and axe) VINA: Quick. If you attack while it's not looking. PIKE: But it's only a dream. VINA: You have to kill him as you did here before. PIKE: You can tell my jailers I won't go along with it. I'm not an animal performing for its supper. VINA: It doesn't matter what you call this, you'll feel it. That's what matters. You'll feel every moment of whatever happens to you. Please, don't you know what he'll do to us? (so Pike fights the killer with mace and shield) PIKE: Why would an illusion be frightened? VINA: Because that's the way you imagined me. PIKE: Who are you? You act as if this were really you. VINA: Careful. (Pike and Vina retreat up some stairs. The killer breaks Pike's spear and they throw objects at it. Pike gets knocked down into the courtyard. The killer grabs Vina and Pike throws a spear into it's back. Then it jumps down and spears itself on a wicked harpoon that Pike grabs just in time) [Pike's cell] VINA: It's over. (Vina hugs her hero, then sees the Talosians watching them. The Talosians leave.) PIKE: Why are you here? VINA: To please you. PIKE: Are you real? VINA: As real as you wish. PIKE: No, no. No, that's not an answer. I've never met you before, never even imagined you. VINA: Perhaps they made me out of dreams you've forgotten. PIKE: What, and dress you in the same metal fabric they wear? VINA: I have to wear something, don't I? I can wear whatever you wish, be anything you wish. PIKE: So they can see how their specimen performs? They want to see how I react, is that it? VINA: Don't you have a dream, something you've always wanted very badly? PIKE: Or do they do more than just watch me? Do they feel with me, too? VINA: You can have whatever dream you want. I can become anything, any woman you've ever imagined. You can have anything you want in the whole universe. Let me please you. PIKE: Yes. Yes, you can please me. You can tell me about them. Is there any way I can keep them from probing my mind, from using my thoughts against me? Does that frighten you? Does that mean there is a way? VINA: You're a fool. PIKE: Since you're not real, there's not much point in continuing this conversation, is there. [Planet surface] (A big laser cannon is aimed at the door in the rock. ONE: All circuits engaged, Mister Spock. SPOCK [OC]: Standing by, Number One. ONE: Take cover. SPOCK [OC]: Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. (The laser cannon blasts away) ONE: Increase to full power! Can you give us any more? SPOCK [OC]: Our circuits are beginning to heat. We'll have to cease power. ONE: Disengage. The top of that knoll should have been sheared off the first second. BOYCE: Maybe it was. It's what I tried to explain in the briefing room. Their power of illusion is so great, we can't be sure of anything we do, anything we see. [Pike's cell] VINA: Perhaps if you asked me some questions, I could answer. PIKE: How far can they control my mind? VINA: If I tell you, then will you pick some dream you've had and let me live it with you? PIKE: Perhaps. VINA: They can't actually make you do anything you don't want to do. PIKE: But they try to trick me with their illusions. VINA: And, they can punish you when you're not co-operative. You'll find out about that. PIKE: Did they ever live on the surface of this planet? Why did they go underground? VINA: War, thousands of centuries ago. PIKE: That's why it's so barren up there? VINA; The planet's only now becoming able to support life again. PIKE: So the Talosians who came underground found life limited here and they concentrated on developing their mental power. VINA: But they found it's a trap. Like a narcotic. Because when dreams become more important than reality, you give up travel, building, creating. You even forget how to repair the machines left behind by your ancestors. You just sit, living and reliving other lives left behind in the thought record. PIKE: Or sit probing minds of zoo specimens like me. VINA: You're better than a theatre to them. They create the illusion for you, they watch you react, feel your emotions. They have a whole collection of specimens, descendants of life brought back long ago from all over this part of the galaxy. PIKE: Which means they had to have more than one of each animal. VINA: Please. PIKE: They'll need a pair of humans too. Where do they get intend to get the Earth woman? VINA: You said that if I answered questions PIKE: But that was a bargain with something that didn't exist. You said you weren't real, remember? VINA: I'm a woman as real and as human as you are. We're like Adam and Eve. If we. Don't. Please don't punish me! (disappears) (Pike sees the Magistrate walk away) (Pike continues to search the walls for a door when a hatch opens and a glass is placed on the floor) MAGISTRATE: The vial contains a nourishing protein complex. PIKE: Is the keeper actually communicating with one of his animals? MAGISTRATE: If the form and the colour is not appealing, it can appear as any food you wish to visualise. PIKE: And if I prefer MAGISTRATE: To starve? You overlook the unpleasant alternative of punishment. (Pike is surrounded by fire and brimstone, screaming in pain) MAGISTRATE: From a fable you once heard in childhood. You will now consume the nourishment. PIKE: Why not just put irresistible hunger in my mind? Because you can't, can you? You do have limitations, don't you? MAGISTRATE: If you continue to disobey, from deeper in your mind, there are things even more unpleasant. (Pike drinks the nourishment then launches himself at the glass wall. The Magistrate steps back in surprise) PIKE: That's very interesting. MAGISTRATE: Now to the female. PIKE: You were startled. Weren't you reading my mind then? MAGISTRATE: As you've conjectured, an Earth vessel did crash on our planet, but with only a single survivor. PIKE: No, let's stay on the first subject. All I wanted for that moment was to get my hands around your neck. MAGISTRATE: We repaired the survivor's injuries and found the species interesting. PIKE: Do primitive thoughts put up a block you can't read through? MAGISTRATE: It became necessary to attract a mate. PIKE: All right, all right, let's talk about the girl. You seem to be going out of your way to make her attractive, to make me feel protective. MAGISTRATE: This is necessary in order to perpetuate the species. PIKE: It seems more important to you now that I begin to accept her and like her. MAGISTRATE: We wish our specimens to be happy in their new life. PIKE: Assuming that's a lie, why would you want me attracted to her? So I'll feel love in a husband-wife relationship? That would be necessary only if you intend to build a family group or perhaps a whole human community. MAGISTRATE: With the female now properly conditioned. PIKE: You mean properly punished! I'm the one who's not co-operating! Why don't you punish me? MAGISTRATE: First, an emotion of protectiveness. Now one of sympathy. Excellent. [Woodland glade] (A picnic spread on a tartan rug, two horses standing by, a futuristic city in the distance) VINA: You want some coffee, dear? I left the thermos hooked to my saddle. PIKE: Tango! You old devil, you. I'm sorry I don't have any sugar. Well, they think of everything, don't they? (feeds lumps to the horse) VINA: Hey, your coffee. Is it good to be home? PIKE: They read our minds very well. Home, anything else I want, if I co-operate, is that it? VINA: Have you forgotten my headaches, darling? I get them when you talk strangely like this. PIKE: Look, I'm sorry they punish you, but we can't let them VINA: My, it turned out to be a lovely day, didn't it? PIKE: It's funny. It's about twenty four hours ago I was telling the ship's doctor how much I wanted something else not very different from what we have here. An escape from reality. Life with no frustrations. No responsibilities. Now that I have it, I understand the doctor's answer. VINA: I hope you're hungry. These little white sandwiches are your mother's recipe for chicken tuna. PIKE: You either live life, bruises, skinned knees and all, or you turn your back on it and start dying. The doctor's going to be happy about one part, at least. He said I needed a rest. VINA: This is a lovely place to rest. PIKE: I used to ride through here when I was a kid. It's not as pretty as some of the parkland around the big cities, but. That's Mojave. That's where I was born. VINA: Is that supposed to be news to your wife? You're home. You can even stay if you want. Wouldn't it be nice showing your children where you once played? PIKE: These headaches, they'll be hereditary you know. Would you wish them on a child or a whole group of children? VINA: Foolish. PIKE: Is it? Look, first they made me protect you and then feel sympathy for you. Now we have these familiar surroundings and a comfortable husband-wife relationship. They don't need all this for just passion. What they're after is respect and mutual dependence. VINA: They say in the olden days all this was a desert. Blowing sand and cactus. PIKE: But we're not here, neither of us. We're in a menagerie, a cage! VINA: No. PIKE; I can't help either one of us if you won't give me a chance. Now, you told me once they used illusions as a narcotic. They couldn't repair the machines left by their ancestors. Is that why they want us, to build a colony of slaves? VINA: Stop it. Don't you care what they'll do to us? PIKE: Back in my cage, it seemed for a couple of minutes that our keeper couldn't read my thoughts. Do emotions like hate, keeping hate in your mind, does that block off our mind from them? VINA: Yes. They can't read through primitive emotions. But you can't keep it up for long enough. I've tried. They keep at you and at you year after year, tricking and punishing, and they won. They own me. I know you must hate me for that. PIKE: Oh, no. I don't hate you. I can guess what it was like. VINA: But that's not enough. Don't you see? They read my thoughts, my feelings, my dreams of what would be a perfect man. That's why they picked you. I can't help but love you and they expect you to feel the same way. PIKE: If they can read my mind, then they know I'm attracted to you. [Talosian monitoring room] PIKE [on monitor]: I was from the very first moment I saw you in the survivor's camp. TALOSIAN: A curious species. They have fantasies they hide even from themselves. VINA [on monitor]: I'm beginning to see why none of this has worked for you. You've been home, and fighting as on Rigel. That's not new to you, either. A person's strongest dreams are about what he can't do. Yes, a ship's captain, always having to be so formal, so decent and honest and proper. You must wonder what it would be like to forget all that. [Open air party] (A band plays, and a green woman dances sensuously) OFFICER: Nice place you have here, Mister Pike. (The dancer is -) PIKE: Vina? ORION: Glistening green. Almost like secret dreams a bored ship captain might have. OFFICER: Funny how they are on this planet. They actually like being taken advantage of. Suppose you had all of space to choose from, and this was only one small sample. ORION: Wouldn't you say it was worth a man's soul? (Pike gets up and leaves. The door he walks through turns into a rock wall. Then Vina is there, holding a blazing torch) [Transporter room] SPOCK: We've located a magnetic field that seems to come from their underground generator. GARISON: Could that be an illusion too? ONE: Now, you all know the situation. We're hoping to transport down inside the Talosian community. SPOCK: If our measurements and readings are an illusion also, one could find oneself materialised inside solid rock. ONE: Nothing will be said if any volunteer wants to back out. (Pitcairn energises but only Number One and Yeoman Colt dematerialise) SPOCK: The women! [Pike's cage] ONE: Captain! Captain. VINA: No! Let me finish! ONE: But we were a party of six. COLT: We were the only ones transported. VINA: It's not fair. You don't need them. PIKE: (grabbing Colt's laser pistol) They don't work. ONE: They were fully charged when we left. It's dead. (communicator) I can't make a signal. What is it? PIKE: Don't say anything. I'm filling my mind with a picture of beating their huge, misshapen heads to pulp, thoughts so primitive they black out everything else. I'm filling my mind with hate. VINA: How long can you block your thoughts? A few minutes, an hour? How can that help? COLT: Leave him alone. VINA: He doesn't need you. He's already picked me. COLT: Picked her? For what? I don't understand. VINA: Now, there's a fine choice for intelligent offspring. COLT: Offspring, as in children? ONE: Offspring as in he's Adam. Is that it? VINA: You're no better choice. They'd have more luck crossing him with a computer. ONE: Well, shall we do a little time computation? There was a Vina listed on that expedition as an adult crewman. Now, adding eighteen years to your age then. (The Magistrate approaches the cell) VINA: It's not fair. I did what you asked. MAGISTRATE: Since you resist the present specimen, you now have a selection. PIKE: I'll break out of this zoo somehow and get to you. Is your blood red like ours? I'm going to find out. MAGISTRATE: Each of the two new specimens has qualities in her favour. The female you call Number One has the superior mind and would produce highly intelligent children. Although she seems to lack emotion, this is largely a pretence. She has often has fantasies involving you. PIKE: All I want to do is get my hands on you. Can you read these thoughts? Images of hate, killing? MAGISTRATE: The other new arrival has considered you unreachable but now is realising this has changed. The factors in her favour are youth and strength, plus unusually strong female drives. PIKE: You'll find my thoughts more interesting. Thoughts so primitive you can't understand. Emotions so ugly (stricken by pain) MAGISTRATE: Wrong thinking is punishable. Right thinking will be as quickly rewarded. You will find it an effective combination. (Magistrate leaves) ONE: Captain. PIKE: No. No, don't help me. I have to concentrate. They can't read through hate. [Bridge] SPOCK: Address intercraft. GARISON: Open, sir. SPOCK: This is the acting captain speaking. We have no choice now but to consider the safety of this vessel and the remainder of the crew. We're leaving. All decks prepare for hyperdrive. Time warp factor. TYLER: Mister Spock, the ship's controls have gone dead. (The lights go out) SPOCK: Engine room! GARISON: Open. SPOCK: Mister Spock here. Switch to rockets. We're blasting out. PITCAIRN [OC]: All systems are out, bridge. We've got nothing. TYLER: There's nothing. Every system aboard is fading out. [Pike's cell] (The group are apparently dozing when the Magistrate opens the hatch to get the laser pistols Pike dropped there. He grabs him and pulls him into the cage, and starts to throttle him) PIKE: Now you hold still, or I'll break your neck. VINA: Don't hurt them. They don't mean to be evil. PIKE: I've had some samples of how good they are. (the Talosian appears to be a vicious monster) PIKE: You stop this illusion, or I'll twist your head off. (it stops) All right, now you try one more illusion, you try anything at all, and I'll break your neck. MAGISTRATE: Your ship. Release me or we'll destroy it. {Bridge] (The senior officers have taken the navigation console apart) SPOCK: Nothing. But for the batteries we'd lose gravitation and oxygen. TYLER: The computers! (The monitor shows a montage of images - space capsules, the Moon, maps of Earth) TYLER: I can't shut it off. It's running through our library. Tapes, micro-records, everything. It doesn't make sense. SPOCK: Could be we've waited too long. It's collecting all the information stored in this fly. They've decided to swat us. [Pike's cell] VINA: He's not bluffing, Captain. With illusion they can make your crew work the wrong controls or push any button it takes to destroy your ship. PIKE: I'm going to gamble you're too intelligent to kill for no reason at all. (Pike hands the Magistrate over to Number One and picks up the laser pistols, firing them at the glass wall. Then he puts one to the Magistrate's head) PIKE: On the other hand, I've got a reason. I'm willing to bet you've created an illusion this laser is empty. I think it just blasted a hole in that window and you're keep us from seeing it. You want me to test my theory out on your head? (There is a hole in the window) COLT: Captain. (They all leave through the hole and get into the elevator to the surface) [Planet surface] (The top of the rocky knoll is split apart) PIKE: Make contact, Number One. ONE: They kept us from seeing this, too. We cut through and never knew it. Captain. (The communicator isn't working) MAGISTRATE: As you see, your attempt to escape accomplished nothing. PIKE: I want to contact our ship. MAGISTRATE: You are now on the surface where we wished you to be. With the female of your choice, you will now begin carefully guided lives. PIKE: And start by burying you? MAGISTRATE: That is your choice. To help you reclaim the planet's surface, our zoological gardens will furnish a variety of plant life. PIKE: Look, I'll make a deal with you. You and your life for the lives of these two Earth women. MAGISTRATE: Since our lifespan is many times yours, we have time to evolve you into a society trained to serve as artisans, technicians PIKE: Do you understand what I'm saying? You give me proof that our ship is all right, send these two back, and I'll stay with Vina. (Number One sets her laser pistol to overload) ONE: It's wrong to create a whole race of humans to live as slaves. MAGISTRATE: Is this a deception? Do you intend to destroy yourselves? VINA: What is that? PIKE: The weapon is building up an overload. A force chamber explosion. You still have time to get underground. Well, go on! (pushes Vina away) Just to show you how primitive humans are, Talosian, you go with her. VINA: If, if you all think it's this important, then I can't go either. I suppose if they have one human being, they might try again. (More Talosians arrive) PIKE: Wait. (Number One turns off the pistol) TALOSIAN: Their method of storing records is crude and consumed much time. Are you prepared to assimilate it? (The Magistrate nods, and the veins on his head throb) MAGISTRATE: We had not believed this possible. The customs and history of your race show a unique hatred of captivity. Even when it's pleasant and benevolent, you prefer death. This makes you too violent and dangerous a species for our needs. VINA: He means that they can't use you. You're free to go back to the ship. PIKE: And that's it? No apologies? You captured one of us, threatened all of us. TALOSIAN: Your unsuitability has condemned the Talosian race to eventual death. Is this not sufficient? MAGISTRATE: No other specimen has shown your adaptability. You were our last hope. PIKE: But wouldn't some form of trade, mutual co-operation? MAGISTRATE: Your race would learn our power of illusion and destroy itself too. ONE: Captain, we have transporter control now. PIKE: Let's get back to the ship. VINA: I can't. I can't go with you. [Transporter room] PITCAIRN: Sir, it just came on. We can't shut the power off. SPOCK: Mister Spock here. TYLER [OC]: All power has come on, Mister Spock. The helm is answering to control. (The transporter platforms light up and first Colt, then Number One are beamed aboard) GARISON: The captain? [Planet surface] (Vina changes into a scarred, misshapen older woman) VINA: You see why I can't go with you. MAGISTRATE: This is the female's true appearance. VINA: They found me in the wreckage, dying. A lump of flesh. They rebuilt me. Everything works. But they had never seen a human. They had no guide for putting me back together. MAGISTRATE: It was necessary to convince you her desire to stay is an honest one. PIKE: You'll give her back her illusion of beauty? MAGISTRATE: And more. (Beautiful Vina and happy Pike go up the slope and into the elevator) MAGISTRATE: She has an illusion and you have reality. May you find your way as pleasant. [Transporter room] PITCAIRN: Mister Spock, the system is coming on again. (Pike is beamed aboard) COLT: What's happened to Vina? ONE: Isn't she coming with us? PIKE: No. No, and I agreed with her reasons. [Bridge] (Pike, Number One and Spock enter) BOYCE: Hold on a minute. PIKE: Oh, I feel fine, just fine. BOYCE: You look a hundred percent better. PIKE: You recommended a rest, a change of pace, didn't you? I've even been home. Does that make you happy? (He bumps into Colt again) PIKE: Yeoman. COLT: Yes, sir. PIKE: I thought I told you that when I'm on the bridge I (She hands him a clip-board stuffed with papers for his signature) PIKE: Oh. Oh yes. The reports. Thank you. COLT: Sir, I was wondering. Just curious. Who would have been Eve? ONE: Yeoman! You've delivered your report. COLT: Yes, ma'am. Yes, sir. TYLER: Eve, sir? Yes, sir. BOYCE: Eve as in Adam? PIKE: As in all ship's doctors are dirty old men. What are we running here, a cadet ship, Number One? Are we ready or not? ONE: All decks show ready, sir. PIKE: Engage.

STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION \"The Child\" TEASER FADE IN: 1 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND THE USS REPULSE (OPTICAL) The Enterprise has rendezvoused with the other Federation ship near the spectacularly beautiful binary system -- Alvacorn Major. 1A INT. ENTERPRISE - SHUTTLE BAY (OPTICAL) The shuttlecraft leaves the Enterprise for the USS Repulse. 2 INT. MAIN BRIDGE Picard is not on the bridge. RIKER has the command chair - DATA is at Science Station, WESLEY is at Conn -WORF is at Tactical. The other positions are filled by n.d. crewmembers. Riker watches the Main Viewer as the shuttlecraft closes with the Repulse. RIKER (to Worf) Open hailing frequencies. WORF Hailing frequencies opened. RIKER Repulse, this is the Enterprise. We are getting underway. REPULSE VOICE Acknowledged, Enterprise. Transfer complete -- good luck on your mission. RIKER And to you. REPULSE VOICE Give my regards to your captain. Repulse out. STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - TEASER 2. 2 CONTINUED: WESLEY The Shuttle Bay is secure. RIKER Thank you Mister Crusher. Make all preparations to get underway. 3 OMITTED 4 INT. CAPTAIN\\'S READY ROOM (OPTICAL) Picard is there with GEORDI. Geordi is showing Picard the plans for a device he is proposing to build. GEORDI We will construct this large enclosure on Cargo Deck Five. The door CHIME SOUNDS. PICARD Come. Riker enters and makes his report. RIKER The transfer is complete. Doctor Pulaski is being shown to her quarters. We are ready to get underway. PICARD Very good. Take a look at the containment module our new chief engineer has designed. Riker steps over. RIKER \"Chief engineer,\" that has a nice ring to it. GEORDI It does to me. (then to business) Each will have total atmospheric control... temperature, radiation, light, humidity, plus electrical spectrums. RIKER And these are put into the large containment area? STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - TEASER 3. 4 CONTINUED: GEORDI Yes, these modules will keep the specimens alive -- the large containment area will keep us alive. Now, I have to go and replicate this five hundred and twelve times. This will mean it will be necessary to divert power from the warp engines to the replicator. PICARD How long will we be on impulse power? GEORDI For a few hours, but it can\\'t be helped. Picard nods. RIKER When we leave \\'aucdet Nine - I\\'m going to want all the power you can slam into those warp engines. GEORDI You\\'ll have it. Geordi exits. PICARD I will relieve you at zero three zero zero. Riker acknowledges and leaves. 5 INT. MAIN BRIDGE as Riker walks back onto the bridge. RIKER Take us out of orbit, Mister Crusher -- set course for \\'aucdet Nine. WESLEY Aye, sir. Course for \\'aucdet Nine has been input. STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - TEASER 4. 5 CONTINUED: RIKER Maximum impulse velocity. WESLEY Aye, sir. RIKER Engage. 6 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL) as it makes a slow graceful turn. 7 EXT. SPACE - ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL) The Enterprise starts as a dot in the distance -- quickly approaches at impulse speed and makes a close passby. After a beat, a heretofore unseen speck begins to glow, then moves -- chasing after the starship. 8 EXT. SPACE - ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL) as the glowing ENERGY closes on the Enterprise. It catches the ship and approaches from the rear -- going between the warp engines. 9 INT. MAIN BRIDGE Minimal crew. Data is at the Science Station studying the display screen. DATA Engineering -- this is Science One. I just observed what appeared to be a random energy transference. 10 INT. CHIEF ENGINEER\\'S OFFICE Geordi is working at the panel on the far wall. GEORDI Where? DATA\\'S COM VOICE Aft. Outboard of the port nacelle. STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - TEASER 5. 10 CONTINUED: GEORDI Hold on -- I\\'ll check. 10A INT. MAIN ENGINEERING Geordi moves to the center console. GEORDI No -- I show nothing here, Data. 11 INT. MAIN BRIDGE Data is not satisfied and continues running checks. RIKER Problem, Commander? DATA Possibly. An unexplained power fluctuation. RIKER Let me know if it reoccurs. 12 EXT. SPACE - CLOSE ON THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL) The ball of light moves closer to the Enterprise. It slides along the skin of the ship; then, without damage to the hull, the ball goes inside. 13 INT. CORRIDOR (OPTICAL) The corridor is empty. If there were nighttime in space, this would be it. The ship is quiet. The little glow of energy emerges. It pauses as though getting its bearings, then cautiously moves off. 14 INT. CORRIDOR - ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL) We FOLLOW the glow as it continues along. The turbolift doors open and TWO CREWMEMBERS exit. The glow blends into the corridor wall and neither crewmember sees it. The glow falls in behind them as they pass. STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - TEASER 6. 15 INT. CORRIDOR - ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL) At an intersection the crewmembers turn left. The energy again pauses, then continues straight ahead resuming its journey - or is it a search? The energy exits up through the overhead. 15A OMITTED 16 INT. CREWMEMBERS\\' QUARTERS (OPTICAL) The energy enters. It pauses over the sleeping form of one of the male crewmembers... then moves away. 17 INT. TROI\\'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL) The energy enters the room, passing effortlessly through the closed door. It pauses -- again getting its bearings. It has a definite sense of purpose as it moves slowly toward the sleeping form on the far side of the room. 18 ANOTHER ANGLE - THE BED (OPTICAL) We recognize COUNSELOR DEANNA TROI. The energy pauses by her head, then LEAVES THE FRAME as it moves down her body. We HOLD on Troi\\'s face. After a beat she turns -- the restless movements of a tortured dream... sweat beads up on her forehead, SUDDENLY she wakes. For a moment she does not move -- then she looks around the room for the \"person\" (lover) she knows must be there. There is no one. The room is empty. But she knows that someone or something has been there and that she will never be the same again. Off her look of concern... and fear... we: FADE OUT. END OF TEASER STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT ONE 7. ACT ONE FADE IN: 19 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL) as it continues along at impulse speed. PICARD (V.O.) Captain\\'s log, Stardate 42073.1. There has been an outbreak of a yet unclassified Plasma Plague in the densely populated Rachelis system. We are on an emergency run to a Federation Research station on \\'aucdet Nine, where specimens of Plasma Plague are kept. We will then transport that deadly cargo to Science Station Tango Sierra, where hopefully an antidote can be manufactured. Every hour we delay, thousands die. 20 OMITTED 20A INT. CARGO DECK FIVE In the center of the huge cargo bay, a crewmember is assembling a very large containment area which will hold the five hundred and twelve modules. GEORDI How\\'s it going? CREWMEMBER Finished, just waiting to insert the modules. 21 INT. MAIN BRIDGE Picard comes out of his Ready Room: PICARD Number One. RIKER Lieutenant La Forge says we will be able to engage the warp drive within the hour. STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT ONE 8. 21 CONTINUED: Picard nods an acknowledgement as he takes his seat. PICARD Mister Data, when we receive a complete list of all the specimens we will be carrying, I want you and Doctor Pulaski to go through it... by the way. Where is our new doctor? Has she reported in? RIKER Not yet. Picard is obviously irritated by the breach in procedure. PICARD Sickbay, this is the captain. SICKBAY VOICE Sickbay, aye. PICARD Is Doctor Pulaski there? SICKBAY VOICE (slight hesitation) Ah... no, Sir. The doctor is in Ten-Forward. PICARD What?! (surprised, then annoyed) A few hours on board and she\\'s already found Ten-Forward. Riker starts to rise. RIKER I\\'ll go and get her. PICARD No, Number One. I\\'ll go. Picard rises and strides toward the turbolift. WORF Not the best way to meet your new captain. STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT ONE 9. 22 INT. CORRIDOR As Picard exits the turbolift, he encounters Wesley. WESLEY Hello, Captain. PICARD (a greeting) Ensign Crusher. Picard continues to stride purposefully down the corridor with Wesley a few steps behind trying to keep up. PICARD I\\'m sorry this mission will delay your reunion with your mother. WESLEY It\\'s all right. I can use the time to finish some projects. PICARD (dismissive) We shouldn\\'t be more than a week or so. Wesley wants to continue the conversation. WESLEY It is going to be hard to leave the Enterprise... PICARD Mixed feelings for all of us. Picard glances back and sees the look of sadness in the young man\\'s eyes. PICARD (continuing) It\\'s always difficult leaving any ship, as it was for your mother when she left to become head of Starfleet Medical. But going from one assignment to another is part of the life which you are choosing. WESLEY Yes, but this isn\\'t \"any\" ship. STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT ONE 10. 22 CONTINUED: PICARD Truly. Wesley stops and watches Picard continue to Ten-Forward. The sadness remains in the young man\\'s eyes. 23 INT. TEN-FORWARD As Picard enters he crosses with a CREWMEMBER. The crewmember\\'s reaction tells us very clearly that Picard is not a frequent visitor to Ten-Forward. We FOLLOW Picard as he walks over to the BARTENDER. This is the first time we get to see this wonderful room. 24 ANOTHER ANGLE - PICARD AT BAR GUINAN is behind the bar. PICARD (greets her) Guinan. She nods a greeting. GUINAN Captain. PICARD Where\\'s Doctor Pulaski? With a hand motion, Guinan indicates a table. 25 ANOTHER ANGLE as Picard approaches one of the tables. We can see that DOCTOR KATHERINE PULASKI is talking with someone, but we cannot see with whom. Picard strides purposefully up. Clearly his ire is up. PICARD Doctor Katherine Pulaski? Pulaski looks up. PULASKI Ah... you must be Captain Picard... STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT ONE 11. 25 CONTINUED: PICARD Doctor -- protocol on your last assignment might have been lax, but here on the Enterprise... PULASKI (she abruptly cuts him off) Sit down, Captain. You better listen to this. 26 ANOTHER ANGLE - TABLE We now see that the doctor is with Troi. Picard and Troi exchange looks. Picard senses trouble and moves a step closer. 27 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE (OPTICAL) Riker, Data, and Worf have assembled. Picard enters with Doctor Pulaski and Troi. As he walks briskly toward his seat. PICARD (he touches his communicator) Lieutenant La Forge, status report. GEORDI\\'S COM VOICE The containment area is completed, the last of the modules are being inserted. PICARD Take us to warp six as soon as possible. GEORDI\\'S COM VOICE Acknowledged. Picard takes his seat and moves on to other -- equally urgent business. PICARD This is Doctor Katherine Pulaski. We will handle the formal introduction later. STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT ONE 12. 27 CONTINUED: The SUBTLE APPRAISALS, the doctor of the crew and the crew of the new doctor, are cut short as Picard takes his seat and announces. PICARD (continuing) Counselor Deanna Troi is pregnant. The reactions of the crew. During what follows we will INTERCUT the reactions of everyone. These will change as each new piece of information is revealed. Data, almost in awe. Life, any life, is amazing to him. Riker glances over at Troi and thinks however briefly of what might have been. Worf -- suspicious, distrustful. RIKER A baby! Worf is noncommittal, Data curious. Riker surprised, and the question is clearly on his mind (whose baby?). RIKER (continuing) This is a surprise. TROI More so for me. Before Riker can react to that statement, Pulaski takes control of the meeting. PULASKI This pregnancy is unlike anything I have ever encountered. Since she came to me a few hours ago, I have made two complete examinations of Counselor Troi. She activates the wall viewer on which appears the sonic representation of a healthy, humanoid fetus. PULASKI (continuing) This is from the first examination. The fetus is about halfway through the first trimester -- about six weeks old. Understand, we... (MORE) STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT ONE 13. 27 CONTINUED: (2) PULASKI (Cont\\'d) (indicating herself and Troi) ... believe conception occurred about eleven hours ago. RIKER What? PULASKI It gets better. The screen changes. PULASKI (continuing) The second exam, an hour later was consistent, except for the fact that the fetus \"appeared\" to be several weeks older. She steps away from the screen. PULASKI (continuing) At this growth rate, Counselor Troi will have her baby within the next thirty-six hours. The normal gestation for a Betazoid is ten months. For a beat, the group is in stunned silence. RIKER I do not mean to be indelicate, but... (pause) ... who\\'s the father? TROI Last night, while I slept... something... which I can only describe it as a presence, entered my body. Troi turns and looks at the image of the fetus. STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT ONE 14. 27 CONTINUED: (3) PICARD A life-form of unknown origin and intent is breeding right now inside Counselor Troi. Our purpose here is to determine what is to be done about this very \"unusual\" situation. Discussion. RIKER Let me get this straight -- Deanna was impregnated by... by what? (to Pulaski) Doctor, what do your tests show? Is it a humanoid? An alien? She stands, goes to the display screen and activates it. PULASKI It\\'s a male human... or in this case half-human -- half-Betazoid. RIKER Exactly the same as Deanna! PULASKI In every way. There is no indication from any of my tests of any other genetic patterns except hers. 28 TROI We HOLD on Troi as she continues to watch the child moving inside her. The discussion fades from her consciousness. RIKER I don\\'t think this is a random occurrence. There is a purpose here -- a reason. What, I don\\'t know. WORF Captain, obviously the pregnancy must be terminated. RIKER Why? STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT ONE 15. 28 CONTINUED: WORF For the safety of the ship and crew. Troi stares at the moving fetus on the viewscreen. Seeing it, alive, helpless, touches other emotions. However it was conceived, it is hers. She does not completely lose her uncertainty and apprehension, but other, stronger instincts begin to emerge. RIKER Worf, you can\\'t assume its intent is belligerent. WORF That is my safest assumption. DATA Captain, this is a life-form. Not to allow it to develop naturally would deny us the opportunity to study it. WORF If the fetus is aborted, laboratory analysis is still possible. RIKER Is there any health risk to Counselor Troi if the fetus is aborted? PULASKI Medically, no. PICARD Doctor, is that your recommendation? As the words swirl around her, she knows in her Betazoid heart that the child must be born, and she makes her decision. Troi gets everyone\\'s attention. TROI Captain, do whatever you feel is necessary to protect the ship and the crew... but know this. I am going to have this baby. Everyone reacts, then: STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT ONE 16. 28 CONTINUED: (2) PICARD I believe that ends the discussion. 29 OMITTED FADE OUT. END OF ACT ONE STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT TWO 17. ACT TWO FADE IN: 30 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL) coming out of warp. PICARD (V.O.) Captain\\'s log, supplemental. We have finally arrived at \\'aucdet Nine. We will pick up the specimens of Plasma Plague and transport them to Rachelis. 30A EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL) approaching \\'aucdet Nine. PICARD (V.O.) (continuing) It is only because so many lives are at stake that I am willing to put this ship and crew at such great risk. 31 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL) Picard is in his command seat, Riker beside him. Data is at Ops and Wesley has the Conn. Troi enters from the aft turbolift. She is FIVE months pregnant. The crew can\\'t help watching as she crosses and takes her place next to Picard. PICARD How are you feeling? TROI I should be feeling uncomfortable with all the changes in my body... but, I\\'m not. I feel fine -- better than fine. Wonderful. There is a look of concern in his eyes - not only for his counselor, but because he still isn\\'t sure what is going to be born onto his ship. RIKER Standard orbit. STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT TWO 18. 31 CONTINUED: WESLEY Standard orbit, aye. PICARD Open hailing frequencies. WORF Hailing frequencies open. PICARD \\'Aucdet Nine, this is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the USS Enterprise. There is a pause, then the viewscreen comes alive. A MAN APPEARS. He\\'s dressed in a disposable lab coat and wearing a twenty-fourth century medical mask pushed up on the top of his head. His name is LIEUTENANT COMMANDER HESTER DEALT. INTERCUT VIEWSCREEN WHERE NECESSARY. HESTER Ah... yes... Enterprise you\\'re here at last. Good. PICARD Excuse me, to whom am I speaking? HESTER Oh... I\\'m Lieutenant Commander Hester Dealt. The medical trustee of the Federation Medical Collection Station. PICARD Are the specimens ready for transfer? HESTER Yes, but with your permission I would like to inspect the containment area before we proceed. It is not that I doubt the ability of your crew; we just cannot afford a mistake. PICARD I appreciate your caution -- in the same vein, I need a complete, detailed manifest of everything which you intend to bring on board my ship. STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT TWO 19. 31 CONTINUED: (2) HESTER I will allow access to the computer banks. The screen returns to a view of \\'aucdet Nine. PICARD (to Data) Download the inventory and go through it with Doctor Pulaski. (to Riker) Number One, arrange to have Hester Dealt transported up. TROI Captain, I\\'m suddenly feeling a little tired. I\\'ll be in my quarters if you need me. Picard nods. Troi gets slowly up and walks to the turbolift. Picard watches her leave. In the b.g. Worf also watches. He is still very uneasy. 32 INT. TROI\\'S QUARTERS She steps up to her sink. She touches her face with a wet cloth as she studies her image in the mirror. The emotional strain of this event is etched on her features. She looks down at her swollen body.... TROI It won\\'t be long now. Soon you\\'ll arrive and so many questions will be answered. The thought makes her smile. 33 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL) in orbit around \\'aucdet Nine. 34 INT. CARGO HOLD FIVE Hester Dealt continues his inspection on the containment area, which is a very large rectangular object suspended off the floor of the Cargo Deck. It has a very sophisticated monitoring system for the hundreds of compartments within. STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT TWO 20. 34 CONTINUED: HESTER This is very good. Exactly what\\'s needed. GEORDI I just followed your instructions. HESTER Good. Exactly what I wanted. Hester moves around the containment area -- over -- under -- up -- down -- inspecting it from every possible angle. HESTER (continuing) Five hundred and twelve compartments. Individually controlled. Very good. Independent of one another. Perfect. Ah, they can be monitored from here. And, isolation is assured. Very, very good. GEORDI I wanted to be sure they wouldn\\'t get out. HESTER Good, Lieutenant. Very good indeed. RIKER\\'S COM VOICE How\\'s it coming, Mister La Forge? HESTER It will be just a little while longer. I want to go over it again in more detail. GEORDI It will be another couple of hours, Commander. HESTER You do understand, it\\'s critical that we have zero growth. STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT TWO 21. 34 CONTINUED: (2) GEORDI (then to Hester Dealt) Oh, yes. I understand. So, you go over it as many times as you want. 34A EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL) in orbit around \\'aucdet Nine. PICARD (V.O.) It\\'s been fourteen hours since we arrived at \\'aucdet Nine. Hester Dealt is making final selections of the specimens we will carry. Meanwhile, we continue to receive desperate pleas from the Rachelis System. 35 INT. MAIN BRIDGE Data is finishing up something at Science One. DATA Captain, the final manifest has been received. PICARD At last. Review it with Doctor Pulaski. I want both of you to be completely familiar with it. DATA Aye sir. Data leaves Science One and crosses to the turbolift. 36 INT. CORRIDOR The turbolift doors open and Data steps into the corridor. As he turns toward Sickbay he sees Troi, walking with some difficulty. He quickly goes to her aid. TROI Data -- help me get to Sickbay. He offers his arm for support and together they continue along. STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT TWO 22. 37 INT. DOCTOR PULASKI\\'S OFFICE The Doctor looks up as someone enters. 38 ANOTHER ANGLE It\\'s Troi and Data. TROI It\\'s time. PULASKI Oh, you bet it is. Let\\'s get you into Sickbay. As she helps Troi through Sickbay, Data touches his communicator. DATA Worf -- assemble your security team in Sickbay. PULASKI Is that necessary? DATA Yes -- captain\\'s orders. He then follows them into Sickbay. PULASKI (to Troi) Strange to need armed guards in the delivery room. TROI Yes, and strange to think my child is the cause. PULASKI Before you referred to it as \"the child,\" now it\\'s become your child. TROI Yes, whatever his beginnings, that\\'s what he\\'s become. They exit Sickbay. STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT TWO 23. 39 INT. SICKBAY - MATERNITY They enter and Pulaski leads Troi to the bed. Her MEDICAL ASSISTANTS move to prepare for the delivery. Data comes up behind them. PULASKI How frequent are your contractions? TROI Very close together. PULASKI In all my other deliveries -- with a couple of exceptions -- the father was present. TROI Difficult under the circumstances. PULASKI It\\'s unfortunate you have to go through this alone. It helps to have someone with you. DATA Perhaps I could serve in that capacity. I can quickly review the procedures I will be required to execute. PULASKI Troi is going to need the comfort of a \"human\" touch... Not the cold hand of technology. Data reaction. TROI Doctor. I think Commander Data will do nicely. A look from the doctor to Troi and back to Data. PULASKI Your choice. 40 ANOTHER ANGLE as the doctor and her assistants prepare Sickbay and Troi for the delivery. STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT TWO 24. 40 CONTINUED: TROI There is nothing specific you have to do, Data, you just have to be with me. PULASKI There is nothing to be nervous about. DATA This is very interesting to me. Although I understand in technical terms how life is formed, there is still a part of the process which eludes my understanding. I began my existence as an adult. I have no memory -- no cognizance of conception, birth, childhood, so to be allowed to witness this event is... Troi grabs his hand. TROI It\\'s happening. DATA (alarmed) Doctor! Pulaski steps over. PULASKI This is an impatient baby. He\\'s eager to make his appearance. She picks up her hypospray. PULASKI (continuing) I\\'ll give you something for the pain. It won\\'t in any way diminish the experience. TROI I have felt no pain. PULASKI None? TROI No... none at all. STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT TWO 25. 40A INT. CORRIDOR - ENTRANCE TO SICKBAY Worf and SECURITY TEAM arrive. 41 ANOTHER ANGLE - SICKBAY They now have Troi in position in the birthing chair. Worf and the security team enter and take up their positions as Pulaski and her Assistant prepare for the delivery. PULASKI Have your security team stand over there. I understand the need to have you here, but keep out from under foot. 42 AND NOW THE BIRTH (INTERCUT THE PIECES OF THE EVENT) This is more than just the wondrous act of life. It has as well the added tension of Worf and his security team. Data, and his first close encounter with creation of the thing he understands least -- life. As this sequence begins, Riker appears in the background. He stands to the side -- out of the way, but there in case his friend, Deanna Troi, needs him. WE WILL LAY THIS OUT, BASED ON HOW A CHILD IS BORN ON THE TWENTY-FOURTH CENTURY ENTERPRISE. And the CHILD comes out -- Worf edges closer -- the doctor takes it to one side. Ties the cord, cleans it, and brings it back to Troi. This is an effortless birth -- no pain -- no strain. PULASKI Are easy births the norm for Betazoids? TROI Not according to my mother. PULASKI (as she hands it to Troi) It\\'s a boy. A normal, healthy, six pound, three ounce baby boy. Then to Worf. STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT TWO 26. 42 CONTINUED: PULASKI (continuing; without any edge) You can come the rest of the way in now. Worf enters and approaches the baby as he would a deadly snake. 43 ANOTHER ANGLE as Worf and the newborn exchange looks. PULASKI No threat here, Lieutenant, you and your men can relax... it\\'s just a baby. Worf reacts. 44 TROI as she holds the baby. Data leans in to see the child. DATA It was remarkable. Thank you for allowing me to participate. PULASKI Do you have a name? TROI Ian Andrew, after my father. PULASKI (she touches her communicator) Captain. PICARD\\'S COM VOICE Picard here. PULASKI Counselor Troi is the mother of a very healthy baby boy. Mother and child are both doing well. PICARD\\'S COM VOICE Counselor, my best wishes to you and your son. STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT TWO 27. 44 CONTINUED: TROI Thank you, sir. Riker now steps forward to pay his respects. He leans down and kisses her on the forehead. TROI (continuing) Have you been here all along? RIKER Yes. (then just for her) He\\'s beautiful, Deanna... just like his mother. (to Worf) I don\\'t think you are going to be needed here, Lieutenant. Worf nods an acknowledgement and leads his security team off. Riker and Troi exchange looks and he too exits. PULASKI How do you feel? TROI Fine. Absolutely wonderful and thank you, Doctor... for everything. PULASKI (as she does a scan of Troi and the baby, her face registers surprise) Amazing. 45 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL) in orbit around \\'aucdet Nine. 46 INT. MAIN BRIDGE The turbolift opens and for the first time Pulaski steps onto the bridge. STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT TWO 28. 46 CONTINUED: PICARD Welcome to the bridge, Doctor. How\\'s Counselor Troi? Did she have a good night? PULASKI I have delivered dozens of babies. But none like this. There was no pain, no trauma. It was effortless for both of them. PICARD I\\'m not sure of your point. PULASKI She had the baby yesterday. If I were to examine her now, I would not be able to tell that she just had a baby, or ever had a baby. It\\'s as though the incident never happened. PICARD (to Data) How long before we are ready to begin the transfer? DATA Two hours, nineteen minutes. PICARD (he stands) You have the Conn, Number One. RIKER Aye, sir. PICARD Doctor, you would accompany me, please. I think it\\'s time I paid my respects. 47 INT. CORRIDOR - ENTRANCE TO TROI\\'S QUARTERS Picard and Pulaski approach the doorway. The CHIME SOUNDS. From inside Troi says: TROI Come in. The doors open and they enter. STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT TWO 29. 48 INT. TROI\\'S QUARTERS Troi\\'s back is to him. She is doing something with her child. PICARD I wanted to come by and see how you were and have a look at your... At this moment the CHILD looks out from around Troi. It is already THREE YEARS OLD! PICARD (continuing) ... baby! My goodness. The Doctor takes out her medical recorder and does a quick body scan of the child. PICARD (continuing) How old is he? PULASKI In actuality a day. PICARD Yes, but... PULASKI ... In appearance, almost four earth years old. TROI Ian, say hello to Captain Picard. PICARD You mean he can talk? The boy answers. IAN Hello. Picard is stunned. PICARD Hello, Ian. Picard moves closer. IAN Don\\'t worry. Everything is fine. STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT TWO 30. 48 CONTINUED: Off their reactions we: FADE OUT. END OF ACT TWO STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT THREE 31. ACT THREE FADE IN: 49 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL) in a parking orbit near \\'aucdet Nine. PICARD (V.O.) Captain\\'s log, supplemental. We are faced with two major problems: Troi\\'s child and the deadly cargo we are about to load, which is so desperately needed in the Rachelis system. In the hours since his birth, Troi\\'s baby has continued to age and now appears, physically and mentally, to be a child of eight. And still there is no indication as to who he is, or why he is here. 50 INT. MAIN BRIDGE Picard and everyone else in place. RIKER Sickbay, this is the bridge. We are ready to begin loading. PULASKI\\'S COM VOICE We need a little more time. It\\'s taking longer than we anticipated. 51 INT. DOCTOR PULASKI\\'S OFFICE (OPTICAL) She is at her desk-top computer terminal as Data enters. PULASKI Data, (she says \"Data\" with a short A) look at this. DATA (he corrects her) Data. STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT THREE 32. 51 CONTINUED: PULASKI What? DATA My name. It is pronounced Data. PULASKI (with a wry smile) Oh? DATA You called me Data. PULASKI What\\'s the difference? DATA One is my name and the other is not. PULASKI Is this possible? Data is puzzled by the apparent non sequitur. Pulaski stands, picks up her medical recorder, steps over to Data and begins a body scan. PULASKI (continuing) In all of your neural nets, algorithms, and heuristics, is there some combination which makes up a circuit for bruised feelings? Data looks confused. PULASKI (continuing) Apparently so, because I think I just offended your tender sensibilities. She looks at the puzzled Data. PULASKI (continuing) Possible? Then with an amused look, gets back to business. STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT THREE 33. 51 CONTINUED: (2) PULASKI (continuing; indicating the CRT) I am unfamiliar with these symbols. Data steps around and examines the screen. DATA It indicates a genetically engineered biological life-form. PULASKI About twenty percent of the specimens fall into that category. (to herself) Some eager beaver at play. DATA Query... \"eager beaver?\" PULASKI In this case, \\'eager beaver\\' refers to some overachieving genetic engineer, who probably for lack of something better to do forced this strain of virus to mutate, just to see how bad, bad can get. (touches her communicator) Captain Picard. INTERCUT WITH MAIN BRIDGE AS NEEDED. PICARD Picard here. PULASKI Just so you fully appreciate the risks we are about to take... PICARD Enlighten me. PULASKI If the most innocuous specimen on the manifest list gets loose, it will destroy all life on the Enterprise in a matter of hours. STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT THREE 34. 51 CONTINUED: (3) PICARD I understand, Doctor. Do you have a recommendation? PULASKI Considering how desperately this is needed, no I don\\'t. Just want you to know what we\\'re carrying. PICARD Thank you, Doctor. Commander Data, if you have completed your review, you are needed in Transporter Room Three. DATA Yes, sir. (to Pulaski) Excuse me, Doctor. PULASKI That\\'s okay... (with long A, then short A) Data, Data... whatever. He gives the doctor a look. Doctor Pulaski returns to her viewscreen. 52 INT. CHILDREN\\'S PLAY AREA (OPTICAL) Troi is standing by the door with the TEACHER (MISS GLADSTONE). They are watching a GROUP OF KIDS playing with a half a dozen puppies. Sitting right in the middle of everything and playing with abandon is IAN, WHO IS NOW ALMOST EIGHT. Troi is enthralled by the actions of her \"son.\" TROI Ian! The boy looks up and smiles when he sees his mother. Then he notices a LITTLE GIRL next to him. Ian takes his hands off the puppy, and puts them (without any sense of threat, just curiosity) on the girl\\'s hair. MISS GLADSTONE He\\'s a very tactile child. He wants to touch and feel everything. STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT THREE 35. 52 CONTINUED: TROI Come on, sweetheart, time to go. Ian scrambles to his feet and trots over to his mother and gives her a big hug. MISS GLADSTONE Unbelievable -- I think he\\'s actually grown since you dropped him off. IAN I like it here, Mommy. TROI I thought you would. Thank Miss Gladstone for having you, and let\\'s go get you something to eat. IAN (to the teacher) Thank you. Ian then turns and waves to the other kids who are still involved with the puppies. IAN (continuing) Bye... Some of the other children wave -- most are too involved in what they are doing to notice. TROI (also to the teacher) Thank you. Miss Gladstone nods an acknowledgement, then watches them leave. Her eyes reflect the amazement she feels about Troi\\'s unusual child. 53 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM THREE Data arrives. TRANSPORTER CHIEF The transporter is not making a positive lock. STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT THREE 36. 53 CONTINUED: DATA The built-in inhibitor is restricting onloading of life-forms known to be hazardous to the occupants of this ship. Have you attempted override? TRANSPORTER CHIEF I don\\'t have the authority. Data steps in behind the console. DATA Computer, recognize -- Lieutenant Commander N-F-N, N-M-I, Data. COMPUTER VOICE Authorization accepted. DATA Initiate override protocol. COMPUTER VOICE Override protocol is not recommended in this situation. DATA Acknowledged. On my authority -- begin override. There is a pause. COMPUTER VOICE Sequence complete. The TRANSPORTER CHIEF inputs the coordinates. TRANSPORTER CHIEF Cargo Deck Five. We will commence transport on your command. 54 INT. CARGO DECK FIVE Riker, Geordi and a couple of crewmembers are by the containment grid. Geordi does a final visual survey of the area. GEORDI Transporter Three -- we are ready to receive. STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT THREE 37. 55 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM THREE as Data watches the Transporter Chief manipulate the controls. 56 INT. CARGO DECK FIVE (OPTICAL) Riker and Geordi watch as the deadly little ampules are BEAMED into position. Next to Geordi is a CRT which reads out the contents of the little containers. GEORDI (to Data) Data, the first batch is in place. Ready for the next. RIKER Inform me when loading is complete and the cargo secure. GEORDI Aye, sir. Riker exits the Cargo Deck as the second batch of specimens appears within the containment grid. 57 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM THREE The Transporter Chief sets in the coordinates and beams up the next load. 58 INT. TROI\\'S QUARTERS Troi and eight-year-old Ian are there. The doors open. Picard and Pulaski enter. PULASKI I wanted to stop by and see how Ian was doing. TROI We\\'re doing fine. I was just going to give Ian his supper. IAN (to Picard) Do you want your supper now, too? PICARD No, Ian, but thank you for the invitation. STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT THREE 38. 58 CONTINUED: IAN You\\'re welcome. A spoon which Ian is playing with more than using, slips out of his hand and falls on the floor. Picard retrieves it. IAN (continuing) Have you ever played with puppies? Picard looks to Troi for an explanation. Troi smiles. TROI They had a litter today in the nursery. PICARD No, I have never played with puppies. IAN You\\'d like it. You should go to the nursery while the puppies are still there. PICARD. Perhaps later. Troi puts the boy\\'s supper down in front of him. It includes some hot steaming soup. Picard and Pulaski watch as Ian examines his food. He tries to touch the steam coming off the soup, then feels the wetness on his little fingers. Everything connected with his physical senses fascinates the child. He sticks his hand into the hot soup and holds it there for a beat: IAN (pulling it out) Ouch... He looks at his scalded fingers. Tears well up in his eyes and like any other child his age; he runs to his mother. IAN (continuing) Ow... Mommy... ow... Troi gathers the boy into her arms as the doctor steps over. STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT THREE 39. 58 CONTINUED: (2) PULASKI Let me look at that. Ian holds out the fingers and watches with great interest as Pulaski uses one of the instruments from the pocket of her smock to medicate the fingers. PULASKI (continuing) It\\'s not serious. Ian studies his fingers as he realizes the pain is gone. Then he touches his cheek and feels the tears. IAN My face is wet. Troi gently dries his tears with the tips of her fingers, then lovingly strokes his hair. TROI Is it better now, sweetheart? The boy nods and cuddles in against his mother. PULASKI He allowed himself to be burned. PICARD Yes, for the experience. PULASKI Who is he? Why is he here? What does he want? 59 PICARD He watches the child intently. PICARD Ian, could you tell us why you are here? IAN Because Mommy said it was time to eat. Reactions from Troi and the doctor. STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT THREE 40. 59 CONTINUED: PICARD No, I mean... why you are here on this ship? IAN I live here. TROI Ian, the captain wants to know if you are ready to tell us why you came here. IAN No. Not yet. Ian picks up the glass, which unlike the soup, this is cold. TROI The answer is within him. When his cognitive powers develop sufficiently, he will be able to articulate it. PICARD I hope he will tell us soon. He takes some of the liquid into his mouth... rolls it around, swallows some, and lets the rest run down his chin. Picard watches as Ian pours some of the liquid onto his leg just to know how it feels, then he turns and walks toward the exit. RIKER\\'S COM VOICE Captain to the bridge. PICARD I\\'m on my way, Number One. (to Troi) Keep me apprised of his progress, Counselor. Pulaski stays behind with Troi and her baby. IAN (too late for Picard to respond) Bye... STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT THREE 41. 60 OMITTED 61 INT. MAIN BRIDGE Picard steps off the turbolift to the bridge. Riker is beside him. Data is at Ops -- Worf at the Tactical Station. The other positions are filled with n.d. crewmembers. RIKER The cargo has been loaded and is secure. PICARD Take us out of orbit, Number One -- then set a course for Rachelis -- warp nine. 62 thru OMITTED 63 64 EXT. TEN-FORWARD (OPTICAL) Wesley steps up to the window, still carrying the weight of his decision. Guinan watches him cross the room and stand in front of the large center window. 65 GUINAN AND WESLEY (OPTICAL) She comes up beside him. GUINAN Can I get you something? WESLEY No. I just wanted to stand here. GUINAN I don\\'t blame you -- it\\'s beautiful. WESLEY Yes. GUINAN How about some nice Mareuvian Tea? WESLEY No. Nothing thank you. STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT THREE 42. 65 CONTINUED: GUINAN You\\'re going to be leaving soon. WESLEY Yes. They both watch as the Enterprise leaves orbit. The planet \\'aucdet Nine slips away. As Wesley watches the ship maneuver into position, Guinan watches him. GUINAN What do you see when you look out there? WESLEY Over there is the Lorenze cluster, and there Arneb and there Epsilon Indi. GUINAN No, I don\\'t mean that. I mean when you look there don\\'t you see your future? Wesley gives her a little sideways look. WESLEY It will still be there. GUINAN How about a cup of nectar direct from Prometheus? WESLEY No -- nothing. That\\'s the third time you\\'ve asked me. GUINAN It\\'s what I\\'m expected to do. Don\\'t you always do what\\'s expected? WESLEY I try to. GUINAN Even if it\\'s not what you really want? STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT THREE 43. 65 CONTINUED: (2) WESLEY Sometimes. Sometimes you have to consider others more than yourself. GUINAN That\\'s true. But sometimes the game is to know when to consider yourself more than others and to give yourself permission to be... selfish. He looks at her. Then -- before he can answer, the Enterprise leaps to warp speed. The star field becomes a spectacular display. We PLAY THE REACTIONS of Guinan and Wesley. 66 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL) moves along at warp speed. 67 INT. CARGO DECK FIVE (OPTICAL) A concerned Hester Dealt is scanning the containment grid with his very sophisticated monitoring equipment. HESTER (real concern) Something\\'s wrong. Geordi approaches Hester Dealt. GEORDI What is it? HESTER Growth. GEORDI Where? HESTER L-seven-three. Geordi steps over to the side of the containment area, and activates a CRT screen. The screen has a display of the 512 modules inside. Each has a series of indicators, ONE ON THE FAR SIDE IS FLASHING. Geordi manipulates the panel so the display turns, giving him a better look at the flashing light. STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT THREE 44. 67 CONTINUED: GEORDI (touches his communicator) Bridge, this is Cargo Deck Five. PICARD\\'S COM VOICE Yes, Lieutenant La Forge. GEORDI There is a malfunction in the containment area. PICARD\\'S COM VOICE How serious? HESTER Very. FADE OUT. END OF ACT THREE STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT FOUR 45.

With a handheld monitoring device, Hester Dealt makes a sweep of the Cargo Deck. GEORDI (touches his communicator) Captain, the power to the containment grid must have somehow been affected when we increased to warp velocity. INTERCUT THE MAIN BRIDGE AS NEEDED PICARD I don\\'t see how that would be possible. GEORDI I don\\'t either, but if we could return to impulse, we would know for sure. PICARD Impulse velocity. 70 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL) as it comes out of warp. STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT FOUR 46. 71 OMITTED 72 INT.

GEORDI There\\'s no change. It wasn\\'t the warp drive. 74 INT. MAIN BRIDGE Picard did not expect any. Riker is on his feet and heading for the turbolift. RIKER Permission to leave the bridge. PICARD Granted. RIKER Commander Data, you\\'re with me. Data leaves his position and follows Riker. PICARD Doctor Pulaski. 75 INT. DOCTOR PULASKI\\'S OFFICE Pulaski is running through some medical records. PULASKI Yes, Captain. PICARD\\'S COM VOICE We are having some difficulties on Cargo Deck Five -- your presence is requested.

Wesley is eating a twenty-fourth century Enterprise version of an ice cream sundae. His mood is much lighter, indicating he has come to some decision regarding his future. WESLEY You never talk about yourself. GUINAN Sure I do... all the time. WESLEY People say you are very old... GUINAN Oh? WESLEY ... and that you knew Captain Picard when he was on the Stargazer. GUINAN No. I never met the captain until I came onboard. WESLEY Everyone is very curious about you. GUINAN I\\'ll bet they are. WESLEY About where you come from. GUINAN Where do they say? WESLEY I heard that you\\'re from Nova Kron and that... PICARD\\'S COM VOICE Mister Crusher, report to the bridge.

GUINAN There\\'s nothing like a dish of Delovian souffle. WESLEY I didn\\'t mean the souffle, I meant for... well... the rest. Thanks. GUINAN That\\'s why I\\'m here. 76 INT. MAIN BRIDGE The turbolift opens and Wesley Crusher comes onto the bridge. PICARD Take the Conn, Mister Crusher. Wesley replaces the crewmember at that position. PICARD (continuing) On this course -- increase velocity to warp nine. WESLEY Aye, sir. Warp nine. 77 OMITTED 78 INT. CARGO DECK FIVE Hester, Data, Riker are gathered around the monitoring equipment. Geordi is off to one side peering at a distant sector of the containment field. THE INDICATOR LIGHT OF L-SEVEN-THREE CONTINUES TO FLASH. STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT FOUR 49. 78 CONTINUED: RIKER Why that module and not the others? DATA Computer, run diagnostic on module L-seven-three. COMPUTER VOICE All circuits functional. GEORDI (reading it off) Temperature -- as set -- minus ninety-seven degrees. Humidity -- twelve percent. Lumins -- zero. Electromagnetic containment integrity... Everything right down the line... exactly as it should be. DATA Perhaps it is a sensor malfunction. Computer -- query. Is growth actually occurring? COMPUTER VOICE Confirmed. 79 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL) as the door opens and Doctor Pulaski enters. She nods a greeting to Riker and the others, then steps over beside Geordi who continues studying the distant section of the containment grid. RIKER One of the specimens is growing. PULASKI (to Hester Dealt) Destroy it, now. HESTER I can\\'t. RIKER Data, prepare to jettison that module. STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT FOUR 50. 79 CONTINUED: HESTER We can\\'t do that either. It will go into a spore and remain until it comes in contact with a planet or another ship. The results would be disastrous. RIKER Commander, your attitude tells me that however bad I think this is... it\\'s worse. HESTER (he indicates the containment area) This is not going to hold it. RIKER Go on. HESTER The rate of growth is increasing. Within thirty minutes it will push out of the module. Within two hours, it will breach the containment area. GEORDI It can\\'t break through this. HESTER Yes it can. RIKER (touches his communicator) Captain. We may not be able to get control of this situation. I recommend making arrangements to transfer all non-essential personnel to the saucer section. If we lose containment we should be prepared to separate. PICARD\\'S COM VOICE Make it so. PULASKI Why this one specimen and none of the others? Something is stimulating it. Do you have its etiology? How it was developed? STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT FOUR 51. 79 CONTINUED: (2) Hester inputs the freestanding viewscreen, and the HISTORY OF \"L-SEVEN-THREE\" APPEARS. Pulaski looks at it. PULASKI It\\'s a mutated strain developed by Doctor Susan Nuress during an outbreak of Plasma Plague seventy years ago in the Oby System. (she pauses as she continues to read) It was number nine in a series of tests. This particular one bombarded by low levels of Eichner radiation. (then she turns to Hester) Could exposure to Eichner radiation stimulate growth? As a reflex act, Hester Dealt makes a sweep of the area with his handheld monitor. HESTER Yes, it could, but... He stops... his expression says... HESTER (continuing) Uh, oh... PULASKI Don\\'t tell me. HESTER I\\'m detecting low levels of Eichner radiation. RIKER Why didn\\'t you catch it before? HESTER Because it wasn\\'t here before.. PULASKI Well, it is now. What emits that type radiation? DATA A subspace phase inverter. STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT FOUR 52. 79 CONTINUED: (3) GEORDI We don\\'t have one. DATA Certain cyanoacrylates. PULASKI Also, not on this ship... What else? Because it\\'s here and we better find it. Data has no answer. 80 INT. TROI\\'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL) Troi is putting the child to bed. She touches a control panel near the windows which turns them to their opaque configuration. IAN I can feel that some of the people are very... worried. TROI Yes. I feel it as well, but don\\'t you worry. IAN It\\'s me Mommy -- I\\'m the reason. TROI What? IAN It\\'s me. TROI You? IAN Yes. I have to leave you now, or it will be very bad for everyone. TROI What are you saying? He smiles up at her. IAN I have to leave now. STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT FOUR 53. 80 CONTINUED: TROI Leave? (senses what he is about to do) You are going to die. No. No, you can\\'t. He smiles up and closes his eyes. TROI (continuing; she touches her communicator) Sickbay, this is Counselor Troi, I need the doctor in my quarters... right now. (then she lifts Ian to her) No... Ian... No. Off Troi\\'s reaction. FADE OUT. END OF ACT FOUR STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT FIVE 54. ACT FIVE FADE IN: 81 INT. TROI\\'S QUARTERS as Pulaski leads the others to Troi\\'s quarters. TROI It\\'s Ian. Please... please hurry. Pulaski moves quickly to the unconscious child; pulls back the covers. She removes an instrument from her smock and makes a scan of the child\\'s body. In the b.g., Picard enters with Riker and Data. TROI (continuing) Save him, you must save him. PULASKI What happened? Did he eat anything? Did he fall? TROI No. Data, using his tricorder, confirms with a nod to Riker. DATA The child is the source of the unusual radiation. TROI He said he\\'s the reason the ship is in danger. DATA That analysis is correct. Pulaski injects the child with hypospray. PULASKI I\\'m losing life signs. Troi stands by helplessly. Like any mother in this situation, she is beyond grief. Tears streak her face. TROI Oh, please. Please save him. STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT FIVE 55. 82 PULASKI resets the injector and again she administers a dose of hypospray. She waits for a reaction. There is none. 83 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL) The room is very quiet. Pulaski stands. PULASKI I\\'m sorry. Troi moves next to the cot on which the child is lying. She is beyond despair. Her heart has completely broken. The others allow her a moment alone, then as Riker is about to move to Troi\\'s side, a LIGHT -- the glowing energy which we saw at the beginning -- gathers from within the child and slowly rises. As it does, the body that was Ian fades away until there is only the LIGHT. 84 INTERCUT REACTIONS (OPTICAL) Troi reaches out and with cupped hands she collects the LIGHT, cradles it gently and brings it to her. As she holds it close, it makes her face all aglow. Slowly the pain and despair drain away, and through the tears she smiles. The joy she now feels shines from her eyes. The Betazoid within her, embraces the essence of the entity before her and she knows now why he came and what he wanted. Then, in an act of pure love, she releases the glowing energy as she would a dove. For a beat the LIGHT seems reluctant to leave. Then it does. It passes effortlessly through the wall of the ship and away. Troi stares after it for a beat. GEORDI\\'S COM VOICE (excited -- relieved) Captain. The containment field has stabilized. PICARD Thank you, Lieutenant. Troi turns and looks at her captain and shipmates. TROI Then Ian was right. He was the cause. STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT FIVE 56. 84 CONTINUED: PICARD Apparently so. Troi pauses, gathering her feelings and picking her words carefully. She settles her emotions. TROI He is a life-force entity... as we passed each other in space he was curious and wanted to know about us, and he thought the best way to learn was to go through the process. To be born, to live as one of us and in that way to understand us. She pauses, then: TROI (continuing) Captain, he never meant any harm. Picard nods -- he knows that is true. RIKER There was a moment when you smiled. TROI (she smiles again) He said thank you. (she pauses) I told him we will miss him -- and I will. The others will also miss him. 85 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL) as it enters orbit near Science Station Tango Sierra. 86 INT. MAIN BRIDGE Picard is in his command chair, Riker beside him, Wesley at Conn. PICARD Standard station approach, Mister Crusher. STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT FIVE 57. 86 CONTINUED: WESLEY Standard approach, aye. PICARD Transporter Room Three, this is the captain. We have arrived. Let\\'s make this transfer with all deliberate speed, and get on about our business. DATA\\'S COM VOICE Yes, sir. RIKER I will be glad to be relieved of this cargo. Picard rises. PICARD You have the bridge, Number One. RIKER Yes sir. As Picard crosses the bridge, Ensign Wesley Crusher buttonholes him. WESLEY Captain. PICARD Yes Ensign? WESLEY Could I see you when you have a moment? PICARD In my Ready Room when your duties permit. WESLEY Thank you, sir. Picard continues on and leaves the bridge. 87 INT. CARGO DECK FIVE (OPTICAL) Geordi and Hester Dealt are standing next to the containment area. STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT FIVE 58. 87 CONTINUED: GEORDI Good luck. The TRANSPORTER BEAM takes over and removes Hester Dealt from the Enterprise. GEORDI (touches his communicator) Data, you can lock on to the first group and begin transporting on my mark. 88 INT. PICARD\\'S READY ROOM The CHIME RINGS. PICARD Come. The doors open. It\\'s Ensign Crusher. He enters and stands in front of Picard\\'s desk. PICARD Yes, Ensign. WESLEY (hesitant) Captain... I have thought about this a lot. I want to remain on the Enterprise. PICARD Oh. Have you discussed this with your mother? WESLEY No, before I do that, I wanted your permission to stay. PICARD Wes, it\\'s a little more complicated than that. WESLEY Captain, for right now... this is where I want to be. This is where I feel I belong. Picard studies the young man for a beat. STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT FIVE 59. 88 CONTINUED: RIKER\\'S COM VOICE Captain -- transfer complete. We are ready to leave orbit. PICARD Make it so, Number One. (then to Wesley) Return to your position. Wesley hesitates a beat because he still hasn\\'t received an answer. 89 INT. MAIN BRIDGE Picard -- followed by Wesley -- comes on to the bridge. Troi steps off the turbolift and takes her place. RIKER All stations secure. PICARD Take us out of orbit, Mister Crusher and lay in a course for the Morgana Quadrant. WESLEY Yes, sir. Picard takes his seat. PICARD (loud enough for everyone to hear) Mister Crusher has requested to remain on the Enterprise. RIKER I\\'m not surprised. How did you respond? PICARD I haven\\'t as yet, Number One. I don\\'t think it\\'s my decision alone. His remaining will cause difficulties for us all. RIKER Yes, indeed. With his mother not around, who will see to his studies? STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT FIVE 60. 89 CONTINUED: PICARD Exactly. That duty would fall to Commander Data. RIKER And, who\\'ll tuck him in at night? WESLEY Come on, Commander. WORF I will accept that responsibility. TROI Well, we know he\\'ll get his sleep. PICARD Then, Number One, that leaves you the task of guiding young Mister Crusher through his most hazardous journey -- from youth to man. Are you willing to serve? RIKER Difficult question... Wesley turns and looks at Riker with a plea in his eyes. INTERCUT look between them. RIKER (continuing) ... Yes, I think I can do that. PICARD All right then. Mister Crusher, communicate with your mother at Starfleet Medical headquarters. Give her my regards and tell her you have my permission to remain on board the Enterprise. There is a big smile on Wesley\\'s face. PICARD (continuing) But, that I will abide by her wishes. WESLEY Yes, sir... thank you sir... I just know she\\'ll agree. STAR TREK: \"The Child\" - 9/20/88 - ACT FIVE 61. 89 CONTINUED: (2) PICARD Now -- if you have course and speed laid in. WESLEY (back to duty) Yes sir, they are. PICARD Then, Mister Crusher -- engage. 90 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL) moves off to its next assignment. FADE OUT. END OF ACT FIVE THE END'"

If lost or destroyed, please notify the Script Department. FINAL DRAFT April 13, 1987 TEASER FADE IN: 1 EXT. SPACE - STARSHIP (OPTICAL) The U.S.S. Enterprise NCC 1701-D traveling at warp speed through space. PICARD V.O. Captain\\'s log, stardate 42353.7. Our destination is planet Cygnus IV, beyond which lies the great unexplored mass of the galaxy. 2 OTHER INTRODUCTORY ANGLES (OPTICAL) on the gigantic new Enterprise NCC 1701-D. PICARD V.O. My orders are to examine Farpoint, a starbase built there by the inhabitants of that world. Meanwhile ... 3 INT. ENGINE ROOM Huge, with a giant wall diagram showing the immensity of this Galaxy Class starship. PICARD V.O. (continuing) ... I am becoming better acquainted with my new command, this Galaxy Class U.S.S. Enterprise. 4 CLOSER ON VESSEL DIAGRAM Showing the details and size of this enormous starship. PICARD V.O. I am still somewhat in awe of its size and complexity. 5 INT. LOUNGE DECK With its huge windows revealing the immense span of the Starship\\'s outer surface. 5 CONTINUED: PICARD V.O. (continuing) ... my crew we are short in several key positions, most notably ... 6 INT. BRIDGE - WIDE ANGLE PICARD, TROI, and DATA seated in the command area. Starfleet LIEUTENANT WORF, a young Klingon, is at the \"Ops\" station and a SUPERNUMERARY is at \"Conn\". PICARD V.O. (continuing) ... a first officer, but I am informed that a highly experienced man, one Commander William Riker, will be waiting to join our ship when we reach our Cygnus IV destination. 7 ANGLE EMPHASIZING PICARD AND DATA As Picard turns to Data: PICARD You will agree, Data, that Starfleet\\'s instructions are difficult? DATA Difficult ... how so? Simply solve the mystery of Farpoint Station. PICARD (smiles) As simple as that. TROI Farpoint Station. Even the name sounds mysterious. PICARD The problem, Data, is that another life form built that base. How do I negotiate a friendly agreement for Starfleet to use it while at the same time snoop around finding how and why they built it? 7 CONTINUED: DATA Inquiry ... the word snoop ... ? PICARD Data, how can you be programmed as a virtual encyclopedia of human information without knowing a simple word like snoop? DATA Possibility ... a kind of human behavior I was not designed to emulate? It is all Troi can do to keep from smiling. PICARD It means \\'to spy, to sneak\\' ... DATA (interrupting; delighted) Ah! To seek covertly, to go stealthily, to slink, slither ... PICARD (wanting to cut it off) Exactly, yes ... DATA ... to glide, creep, skulk, pussyfoot, gumshoe ... Data trails off his words, finally becoming aware of the annoyance registering on Picard\\'s face. Troi cannot keep back the smile now ... then suddenly her face is contorted in pain. TROI Captain ... I\\'m sensing a ... a powerful mind ... Interrupted by the sound of a BRIDGE ALARM. 8 WIDER ANGLE All checking their consoles, puzzled at readings they\\'re getting. WORF Something strange on the detector circuits ... 8 CONTINUED: OVERLAPPED by an ever more compelling SECOND BRIDGE ALARM (similar to the old naval HONKING SOUND) begins to sound. At the same time, the main viewer FLICKERS and an unusual SHINING, SPARKLING GRID SHAPE APPEARS stretching across the whole of the galaxy ahead of them. 9 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND GRID (OPTICAL) Emphasizing the incredibly SHINING GRID which the Enterprise is approaching. Seeming impossibly large, yet in some ways as delicate as a spiderweb, it is composed of interlocking geometrical shapes. 10 INT. BRIDGE - VARIOUS ANGLES Data is looking up from his command position console, showing as much alarm as we\\'ll ever see on his face. DATA It registers as solid, Captain... TROI Or an incredibly powerful forcefield. But if we collide with either ... PICARD (to Conn) Go to Condition Yellow. And shut off that damned noise. Conn turns OFF honking sound. Picard is taking time to check all readings but we\\'re now coming very close to the strange grid. WORF Shields and deflectors, up, sir. Milking the drama of approaching collision. Then, conversationally: PICARD Reverse power, full stop. CONN Controls to full stop, sir. The strange shimmering GRID on the viewer is now very close to us as Enterprise movement stops. CONN Now reading full stop, sir. 10 CONTINUED: Overlapped by something akin to a ROLLING THUNDER STORM accompanied by a BRILLIANT AND SUSTAINED FLASH OF LIGHT ON THE BRIDGE to the side of Picard. The light burst physically shakes all bridge crew for an instant, then RESOLVES ITSELF INTO A HUMAN SIZE FIGURE standing at that point on the bridge. As the bridge crew\\'s eyes adjust, it does indeed appear to be a human ... but one dressed and posturing as an Elizabethan era sea captain complete with Sir Walter Raleigh type \"court dress\", complete with neck ruffles, lace, leg stockings, ceremonial sword, etc. Now and later, we shall know this life form as \"Q\". 11 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL) as \"Q\" (Elizabethan) makes a formal bow (of that same era) to Picard. At which the turbolift doors snap open and TWO SECURITY CREW members start to ENTER, led by Security and Weapons Officer NATASHA YAR. However, \"Q\" merely gives a nod in that direction and a miniature of the space grid outside APPEARS AT THE TURBOLIFT ENTRANCE, barring the security team\\'s entrance and CLOSES THE TURBOLIFT DOORS. Then \"Q\" turns toward Picard. \"Q\" (ELIZABETHAN) You are notified that your kind has infiltrated the galaxy too far already. You are directed to return to your own solar system immediately. 12 ANGLE TO INCLUDE OPS AND CONN We will see Conn stealthily, carefully reaching to the small phaser on his belt. PICARD That\\'s quite a directive. Would you mind identifying what you are? \"Q\" (ELIZABETHAN) We call ourselves \"the Q\". Or you may call me that; it\\'s all much the same thing. (indicating costume) And I have presented myself to you as a fellow ship captain so that you will better understand me. (indicates) Go back from where you... 13 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL) Interrupted by Conn drawing his phaser. But \"Q\" barely nods toward Conn at which a FLUTTERING ELECTRIC BLUE WAVE envelopes that bridge crewman, and we HEAR THE BRIEF BEGINNINGS OF A SCREAM as Conn falls with the SOUND of a frozen hard object striking the deck. Picard comes to his feet, ignoring \"Q\" as: \"Q\" (ELIZABETHAN) Stay where you are! 14 EMPHASIZING PICARD Who is clearly very angry as he kneels at the prone form of Conn who appears to have been instantly frozen solid. Troi hurries INTO SHOT kneeling too. There is even white evaporation vapor rising up from the body. PICARD Data, call medics! TROI He\\'s frozen. Can you feel the cold? Picard grabs up Conn\\'s phaser from the deck (reversing it, wisely), stands and puts it under \"Q\\'s\" nose. PICARD He would not have injured you! (indicates phaser) Do you understand this; the stun setting? \"Q\" (ELIZABETHAN) Knowing humans as you do, Captain, would you want to be captured helpless by them? (moves closer) Now, go back or you will certainly die! FADE OUT: PART ONE FADE IN: 15 EXT. U.S.S. ENTERPRISE AND GRID (OPTICAL) Appropriate THEME MUSIC with spaceship hanging motionless, still facing the mysterious SHIMMERING GRID that stretches in front of it from galaxy horizon to horizon. 16 INTO. BRIDGE - EMPHASIZING CONN\\'S FORM In the b.g. on a floating stretcher Conn is being taken to the turbolift, advanced medical emergency aids are attached to his body. PICARD Is he still alive? MEDIC For now. We\\'ll do our best, sir. 17 EMPHASIZING \"Q\" (OPTICAL) Ignoring the previous, intent instead on inspecting his Elizabethan costume as Picard comes up to him. \"Q\" (ELIZABETHAN) Your little centuries go by so rapidly, Captain. Perhaps you\\'ll understand this better. The Visitor moves his hand slightly. We hear the same ROLLING THUNDER SOUND. Another BLINDING LIGHT FLASH and his body remains the same humanoid face and figure as with the Elizabethan dress, but now the green officer\\'s uniform of the U.S. Marine Corps. Over his jacket pocket three rows of medals and his narrow garrison cap shows the bars of a Captain. \"Q\" (MARINE CAPTAIN) Actually, the issue at stake is patriotism. You must return to your world and put an end to the communists. All it takes is a few good men. PICARD What? That nonsense is centuries behind us! 17 CONTINUED: \"Q\" (MARINE CAPTAIN) But you can\\'t deny Captain, that you\\'re still a dangerous, savage child-race. PICARD Most certainly I deny it. I agree that we still were when ... (indicating) ... humans wore costumes like that four hundred years ago... \"Q\" (MARINE CAPTAIN) At which time you slaughtered millions in silly arguments about how to divide the resources of your little world. And four hundred years before that you were murdering each other in quarrels over tribal god-images. And since there have been no indications that humans will ever change ..... PICARD But even as far back as... ! (indicates) ... that costume, we had begun to make rapid progress. \"Q\" (MARINE CAPTAIN) Oh? Shall we review your \"rapid progress\"? 18 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL) The \"Q\" visitor moves a hand again to create THE SAME SOUNDS and the SAME BLINDING FLASH, producing the same human image but this time unshaven and with an UGLY AUTOMATION LOOK AND IN THE UNIFORM OF A MILITARY OFFICER FROM THE MID 21st CENTURY WARS. Q\\'s voice sounds a bit drugged now as he eyes his new costume. \"Q\" (21ST CENTURY) (interrupting) Rapid progress to where humans learned to control their military with drugs. 19 ANGLE INCLUDING OPS POSITION As Worf gets a message and turns toward Picard. 19 CONTINUED: WORF Sir, sickbay reports that Lieutenant Graham\\'s condition is better. All have turned toward Worf, showing relief. \"Q\" (21ST CENTURY) Concern for one\\'s comrade. How touching. WORF (indicates \"Q\") And now, sir, a personal request. Permission to clean up the bridge? Picard shakes head, stares Worf down when he seems about to protest. Meanwhile Tasha has come to her feet too: TASHA Lieutenant Worf is right, sir. As Security Chief I can\\'t just stand here and .... PICARD Yes, you can, Tasha. During this, \"Q\" has withdrawn a slender tube attached to his 21st Century uniform, makes an adjustment which lets a round pill roll into his mouth and bites down on it with a \"POP\" SOUND. \"Q\" (21ST CENTURY) Ah, yes... better! (deep breath, feeling it) Then later, on finally reaching deep space, humans of course found enemies to fight out there too. And to broaden those struggles.... (indicating Worf and Tasha) .... you again found allies to permit still more murdering and all over again the same old story. 19 CONTINUED: (2) PICARD (interrupting; angry) No! The most dangerous \\'same old story\\' is the one we\\'re meeting now! Those who go on misinformation, half-information, self-righteous life forms who are eager not to learn but to prosecute, to judge anything they don\\'t understand or can\\'t tolerate. \"Q\" (21ST CENTURY) What an interesting idea. Prosecute and judge? CAMERA CENTERS ON \"Q\" as he absorbs what Picard has said. He takes a step or two, turns. \"Q\" (21ST CENTURY) (continuing) And suppose it turns out we understand you humans only too well? PICARD We\\'ve no fear of what the true facts about us will reveal. \"Q\" (21ST CENTURY) The facts about you? Splendid, splendid! You are a veritable fountain of good ideas. (smiling; pleasant) There are preparations to make, Captain, but when I return... \"Q\" gives a 21st Century salute to Picard. \"Q\" (21ST CENTURY) (continuing) ... we will proceed exactly as you suggest! A BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT and the alien visitor is gone. 20 WIDE ANGLE ON BRIDGE It takes a moment to accept the fact \"Q\" is really gone then Worf turns to Picard. 20 CONTINUED: WORF Sir... respectfully submit our only choice is to fight. If we Klingons understand anything, it is the meaning of that kind of talk. TASHA My sentiments too, sir. Fight or try to escape. 21 ANGLE EMPHASIZING PICARD Turning to Troi: PICARD Sense anything, Commander? TROI (shakes head) Its mind is much too powerful, sir. And frightening. Concur we avoid further contact if possible! 22 ANGLE EMPHASIZING PICARD Clearly he has to come up with something. He reflects for a moment more, then makes up his mind, turns to Troi. PICARD From this point, no station aboard, repeat no station, for any reason will make use of signals, transmission or intercom. (crossing quickly to Ops and Conn) We\\'ll try to take them by surprise. (to Worf) Inform engineering to make ready for maximum acceleration. We\\'ll find out what this Galaxy Class can do. WORF Aye, sir. As Worf stands and hurries off, Picard turns to Data. 22 CONTINUED: PICARD Records search, Data. Results of detaching the Saucer Section at high warp speeds. Data quickly draws on his memory. DATA Inadvisable at any warp speed, sir. PICARD Search theoretical. DATA (thinking; then) It is possible, sir. But absolutely no error margin. Picard nods and stands, RAISES VOICE: PICARD Attention bridge crew! 23 VARIOUS ANGLES Picard waits until all are turned toward him. PICARD (continuing) Using print-out only, notify all decks to prepare for maximum acceleration. Maximum, you\\'re entitled to know, means we\\'ll be pushing our engines well past safety limits. Our hope is to surprise whatever that is out there, try to outrun it. (looks around, then) Our only other option would be to put tail between our legs and return to Earth as they demand. 24 INT. ENGINE ROOM - TRAVELING WITH WORF As he takes us into WIDE CAMERA ANGLE, aiming both for a feeling of the starship\\'s huge size and enormous power. 25 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL) Worf nodding at a reading which an Engineer shows him, then EXITING to return to the bridge. Meanwhile, engineering personnel work at their controls and a LOW PITCHED WHINE quickly works itself up into a DEAFENING HIGH PITCHED SHRIEK while ENERGY DISPLAYS APPEAR AT MAIN ENGINE CONNECTIONS. 26 EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL) Showing both the Enterprise and the mysterious grid. 27 INT. BRIDGE - ANGLES INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER Worf enters bridge from turbolift, crossing to his position. WORF Engine room ready, sir. Picard stands behind Data who is at the Conn position. TROI The board shows \\'green\\', Captain. All go! Picard moving back to his command position as: PICARD Stand by... (takes his seat, checks bridge, then) ENGAGE! The entire bridge SHUDDERS under a SCREAM OF POWER as we CUT TO: 28 EXT. SPACE - ANGLE ON ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL) Suddenly into maximum warp, the energy release momentarily DISTORTING BOTH THE ALIEN GRID AND THE STARS IN SIGHT AROUND IT. When the EFFECT is over, the starship has turned, seeming to almost brush against the mysterious grid, and is then racing away from it. 29 ANGLE EMPHASIZING GRID (OPTICAL) With Enterprise in b.g. at warp speed, escaping. Then the \\'grid\\' suddenly shrinks in size, growing brighter as it coalesces together INTO THE SHAPE OF A BRIGHTLY COLORED SPINNING SHAPE which now races after the Enterprise. 30 INT. BRIDGE - VARIOUS ANGLES The faces of the bridge crew reflect the fact that Enterprise is at very high warp speed and continuing to accelerate into even higher warp. WORF Velocity warp nine point two. DATA Heading, 351 Mark 11, sir. PICARD Steady on that. TASHA The hostile is now giving chase, sir. Accelerating fast. WORF We\\'re now at Warp nine point three, sir. Which takes us past the red line, sir. PICARD Continue accelerating. (to Troi) Counselor, at this point I\\'m open even to guesses about what we\\'ve just met. TROI (considers, then) It... it felt like something beyond what we\\'d consider a \\'life form\\'. PICARD \\'Beyond\\'? TROI Very, very advanced, sir. Or... (considers) Or certainly, very, very different! 30 CONTINUED: WORF (with emphasis now) Sir, we\\'re at warp nine point four. TASHA Hostile is now beginning to overtake us, sir. PICARD Are you sure? DATA Hostile\\'s velocity is already warp nine point six, sir. Shall I put them on main viewer? PICARD (nods) Reverse angle on viewer. 31 ANGLE INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER VIEWER IMAGE SHIMMERS into reverse view, which is much the same as the forward view except for ONE BLINKING POINT OF LIGHT AT IMAGE CENTER. DATA Magnifying viewer image. ANOTHER VIEWER SHIMMER with the CENTER POINT OF LIGHT BECOMING THE SPINNING COALESCENCE seen earlier. It\\'s still far away, tiny in size, but will grow in size during later SCENES. 32 VARIOUS ANGLES as needed. TASHA Hostile\\'s velocity now at nine point seven, sir. PICARD Ops, inform Engineering we need more! DATA Engine room attempting to comply, sir. But they caution us... 32 CONTINUED: PICARD (interrupting; to Data) Go to yellow alert! Data hits a control and the Yellow Alert ALARM SOUNDS FIVE TIMES. Then Picard turns to Tasha. PICARD (to Tasha) Arm photon torpedoes, Weapons Station. Place them on ready status. TASHA Torpedoes to ready, sir. Picard is aware of the concerned glances received form Troi and Data. 33 WIDE ANGLE The entire bridge suddenly SHUDDERS HARD and it brings startled looks to the faces of some of the bridge crew. Then the motion eases. WORF That was a design tremor, sir. A warning. TASHA Hostile now at warp nine point eight, sir. WORF Our velocity is only nine point five, sir. DATA Projection, sir. We may be able to match the hostile\\'s nine point eight, sir. But at extreme risk. TASHA Now reading the hostile at warp nine point nine, sir. Picard stands, raising his voice to carry throughout the bridge. 33 CONTINUED: PICARD Attention bridge. Print-out message, urgent, to all decks. (selecting the right words) All stations on all decks, make ready to detach ship\\'s saucer section. Some of the bridge crew is startled but all are soon putting their consoles in order for the move. Picard turns to Worf at \\'conn\\' position. PICARD (continuing) You will command the saucer section, Lieutenant. Worf comes to his feet in protest. WORF I am a Klingon, sir. For me to seek escape while my captain goes into battle.... PICARD (interrupts hard) You are a Starfleet officer, Lieutenant. WORF (hesitates, takes seat) Aye, sir. PICARD (to bridge again) Note in ship\\'s log that at this startime, I am transferring command to the Battle Bridge. (to Data) Make the signal, Data. Data touches a control and we HEAR (still preserved from surface ship days) the BUGLE CALL \"BEAT TO QUARTERS\" which continues REPEATING as all bridge crew members (except Worf) begin leaving their posts. While SUPERNUMERARIES arrive on the turbolifts, our bridge crew begins exiting the bridge. FADE OUT. PART TWO FADE IN: 34 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL) Still at high warp. We cannot see the image of the following \"hostile\" (which is not magnified in this ANGLE). PICARD V.O. Captain\\'s log, stardate 42354.1. Preparing to detach saucer section. 35 INT. BATTLE BRIDGE As the turbolift doors snap open, Picard and the others ENTER the smaller, sparse and functional Battle Bridge. PICARD V.O. ... so that families and the majority of the ship\\'s company... 36 INT. MONTAGE OF SAUCER SETS Families, children, science technicians, etc., moving into safe areas. PICARD V.O. (continuing) ... can seek relative safety while our vessel\\'s stardrive, containing our Battle Bridge... 37 INT. BATTLE BRIDGE - VARIOUS ANGLES Acquainting us with the smaller and more severe battle bridge, its configuration and positions. Picard is speaking the balance of his log entry to the microphone at his command position. PICARD (continuing) ... and main armaments, will turn back and confront the mystery that is threatening us. (turning to Tasha) Lieutenant, your torpedoes must detonate close enough to the hostile to blind it at the moment we separate. 37 CONTINUED: TASHA Understood, sir. PICARD Worf, this is the Captain.... 38 INT. BRIDGE - EMPHASIZING LT. WORF The young Klingon at the Captain\\'s command station now. WORF Yes Captain? PICARD\\'S INTERCOM VOICE Begin countdown.... (touches panel control) Mark! 39 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL) Traveling through space for a moment, then photon torpedoes blasting out of the starship\\'s aft tubes. The torpedo pattern disappears into the distance behind the vessel. 40 INT. BATTLE BRIDGE All intent on what is happening as: TROI All decks acknowledging, sir. DATA Starship separation.... six, five, four, three, two, one.... 41 EXT. ENTERPRISE - ANGLES ON SEPARATION MECHANISM (OPTICAL)) As we see the largest of the assemblies begin to move, yawning open. Other mechanisms are doing their jobs too.... and THE MONOLITHIC STARSHIP DIVIDES INTO ITS TWO SECTIONS.... STARDRIVE AND SAUCER MOVING APART. PICARD V.O. Ship\\'s log, exact moment of separation, stardate 42354.22. As the Stardrive Section gets safely clear of the saucer, it begins turning, doubling back to face the \"Q\" menace. And now in the direction of that threat, we begin to see PHOTON EXPLOSIONS in the far, far distance. 42 INT. BATTLE BRIDGE - INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER On which we see a tiny but SOMEWHAT LARGER IMAGE OF THE HOSTILE VESSEL in front of which the last few PHOTON DETONATIONS HAPPEN AND FADE AWAY. TASHA All torpedoes have detonated, sir. PICARD (to Data) Reverse power and hold this position. DATA (gives a surprised look) Reverse power...decelerating. TROI That will bring them here in just minutes, sir. TASHA Will we make a fight of it, Captain? If we can at least damage their ship.... PICARD (indicating viewer) Lieutenant... are you recommending we fight a life form that can do all those things? (as Tasha hesitates) I\\'d like to hear your advice. TASHA I... spoke before I thought, sir. We should look for some way to distract them from going after the saucer. DATA All forward motion stopped, sir. PICARD (to Troi) Commander, signal the following in all languages and on all frequencies: we surrender. State that we are not asking for any terms or conditions. TROI Aye, sir. All language forms and frequencies. 43 ANGLE ON MAIN VIEWER Where the IMAGE OF THE HOSTILE is rapidly growing in size. 44 EXT. SPACE - U.S.S. ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL) As the HOSTILE IMAGE rushes down on the starship, THE COALESCENT SHAPE OPENING UP INTO SOMETHING LIKE THE SHIMMERING GRID WE\\'VE SEEN, but now as if to enclose (and perhaps crush) the starship. A FURY OF SOUNDS like CLANKING-SCREAMS OF METAL BEING STRESSED BEYOND ITS LIMITS. 45 INT. BATTLE BRIDGE - VARIOUS ANGLES As the bridge and the entire Stardrive Section is SHAKEN ALMOST ANGRILY as the same CACOPHONY OF CLANKING-SCREAMS continues. All bridge crew cling to their seats until the SHAKING AND SOUNDS REACH A PEAK. As when \"Q\" first appeared, FLASHES OF LIGHT BLIND US and become: 46 INT. \"Q\" COURTROOM - EMPHASIZING PICARD, DATA, TROI, TASHA It is an immense courtroom meant to reflect strength and power. (We\\'ll discover that it dates back to the mid-21st Century post-atomic crisis era.) Both decor and legal procedures reflect the time when a desperate humanity, still wounded and bleeding from nuclear war, sought answers to its pain and problems through the merciless strength of a new form of dictatorial government representing neither capitalism nor communism. Our four starship people are in old, ragged and stained uniforms which \\'demean\\' them as criminals. In comparison with the gleaming steel and glass of the rest of the courtroom, the Prisoner\\'s Dock at which our people sit is made of rough-hewn, hard and ugly wooden benches. Suddenly, our Starfleet group is CAUGHT IN A HARSH GLARING SPOTLIGHT. Data, looking around with great curiosity, is the first to speak: DATA Historically intriguing, Captain. Very, very accurate. PICARD (nods) Mid-21st Century, the post-atomic horror.... Interrupted by the SOUND OF A BELL, and CUT TO: 47 ANGLE INCLUDING MANDARIN-BAILIFF Important, the MANDARIN-BAILIFF is not a fun figure. Despite the Asian robe and accent, he is an important authority figure--and his expression and actions underscore this. He caries a slim, portable view screen, the face of which contains scrolled information he will occasionally refer to. Now, as he nods to a Court Functionary who uses an ancient, oriental bell, DOLEFULLY CLANGING to gain attention. MANDARIN-BAILIFF All present, make respectful attention to honored Judge! 48 ANGLE EMPHASIZING SPECTATORS Some still arriving, chattering in excitement, having to be intimidated into silence by a 21st CENTURY SOLDIER, heavily armed. Picard waves in a way indicating Data, Tasha and Troi should not stand. TROI (quietly to Picard) Careful, sir. This is not an illusion or a dream. PICARD But these courts happened in our past.... TROI I don\\'t understand either, but this is real. I can feel that! 49 OTHER ANGLES AS NEEDED A 21st Century MILITARY OFFICER moving to our Starfleet group, leveling his automatic weapon toward them. FUTURE MILITARY OFFICER Get to your feet, criminals! Our people ignore him too. \"Mandarin-Bailiff\" is CLANGING THE BELL again. Data sees something, indicates: DATA At least we are acquainted with the judge, Captain. 50 ANGLE ON JUDGE The \"judge\\'s bench\" (an appropriate 21st Century design on Chapman camera-crane) comes floating into the courtroom. Seated in it is \"Q\" (JUDGE), an arrangement which gives \"his Honor\" physical access to every part and corner of this courtroom. As he floats serenely over spectators\\' heads, suddenly there\\'s the RATATATTAT of an automatic weapon. 51 ANGLE INCLUDING MILITARY OFFICER Just completing FIRING a warning burst at the feet of Picard. MILITARY OFFICER (screaming angrily) Attention! On your feet, attention! But Tasha pivoting in fast, taking the weapon and throwing the Officer crashing to the floor. Judge\\'s \"bench\" (Camera Crane) brings \"Q\" INTO SCENE fast. \"Q\" (JUDGE) You are out of order! But he\\'s speaking to the downed military officer, not to Tasha. Which turns out to be a sentence of death -- carried out by a pair of Soldiers who step in, raising their automatic weapons, FIRING at the Officer lying on the floor. Spectators break into APPLAUSE as the Officer slumps and lies unmoving. \"Q\" (JUDGE) (continuing) The prisoners will not be harmed... (a glance at Picard) Until they are found guilty, of course. Still hovering over the fallen officer, \"Q\" indicates the body. \"Q\" (JUDGE) (continuing) Dispose of that. Picard has taken the automatic weapon from Tasha. 51 CONTINUED: PICARD Can we assume you mean this will be a fair trial? \"Q\" (JUDGE) Yes, absolutely equitable. Picard hands the weapon to \"Bailiff\". \"Q\" (JUDGE) swings his \"bench\" to CENTER FRONT of the courtroom. \"Q\" (JUDGE) (continuing to Mandarin-bailiff) Proceed. MANDARIN-BAILIFF (refers to his portable viewscreen) Before this gracious court now appear these humans to answer for the multiple and grievous savageries of their species. Judge\\'s \"bench\" swings \"Q\" (JUDGE) in literally nose-to-nose with Picard. \"Q\" (JUDGE) How plead you, criminal? DATA If I may, Captain.... (gets a nod) Objection, your honor. In the year 2016, the new United Nations declared that no Earth citizen could be made to answer for the crimes of their race or forbearers. \"Q\" (JUDGE) Objection denied! Followed by CLANGING OF BAILIFF\\'S BELL and CHEERS FROM THE SPECTATORS. 52 ANGLE EMPHASIZING \"Q\" AND PICARD \"Q\" (JUDGE) (continuing) This is a court of the year 2049, by which time more \\'rapid progress\\' had caused all \\'United Earth\\' nonsense to be abolished. 52 CONTINUED: At which point Tasha comes to her feet very angry. PICARD Tasha, no... TASHA I must... (to \"Q\") ... because I grew up on a world that allowed things like this court. And it was people like these that saved me from it. I say that this so-called court should get down on its knees to what Starfleet is, what it represents... 53 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL) And \"Q\" (JUDGE) flies INTO SCENE, gesturing toward Tasha as he did earlier to Conn on the bridge... resulting in the same FLUTTERING ELECTRIC BLUE WAVE THAT ENVELOPES HER. As Tasha goes rigid, frozen, Data supports her, lowers her form gently to the floor as: TROI (shouting to \"Q\") You barbarian! That girl.... \"Q\" gestures and the same FLUTTERING ELECTRIC BLUE WAVE ENVELOPS HER TOO. Picard leaps in, keeps her frozen, rigid form from crashing down. MANDARIN-BAILIFF Criminals keep silence! 54 ANGLE ON PICARD bending over Tasha, then to \"Q\": PICARD You\\'ve got a lot to learn about humans if you think you can torture us or frighten us into silence. (to Data) Are they still alive? DATA Uncertain. Lieutenant Graham was when our medics thawed him out. 54 CONTINUED: \"Q\" (JUDGE) glides in closer on his \"bench\". \"Q\" (JUDGE) You will answer the charges! PICARD Or what? Or this, or worse? Or death? I suggest you take a better look at human history. Spectators have begun GRUMBLING over Picard\\'s failure to answer \"Q\". \"Q\" (JUDGE) You are charged, criminals. How plead you? PICARD Just a moment ago, you promised \"the prisoners will not be harmed.\" We plead nothing so long as you break your own rules. LOUDER GRUMBLING from the Spectators now. \"Q\" (JUDGE) I suggest you center your attention on the trial, Captain. It may be your only hope. PICARD And I suggest you now may be having second thoughts about this trial! You\\'re considering that if you conduct it fairly, which was your promise, you may lose. \"Q\" (JUDGE) (laughs) Lose? PICARD Yes, even though you\\'re judge, and prosecutor.... \"Q\" (JUDGE) (nods) And jury. 54 CONTINUED: (2) PICARD (considers it; nods) Accepted... so long as you keep to your agreement. (indicates Troi and Tasha) And assaulting prisoners is hardly a fair trial. 55 OPTICAL ANGLE ON \"Q\" (OPTICAL) Seems to be considering it. Then he looks downward, indicates. \"Q\" (JUDGE) This is a merciful court. \"Q\" waves his hand DOWNWARD TO WARD TROI AND TASHA AND A RIPPLE OF LIGHT plays over the two women, UNFREEZING THEM. ANOTHER ANGLE \"Q\" (JUDGE) The court very disorderly now with some spectators standing on their benches SHOUTING as an annoyed \"Q\" brings his \"bench\" up hovering over the heads of everyone. \"Q\" (JUDGE) (greatly AMPLIFIED) SILENCE! The order is so LOUDLY AMPLIFIED that it comes near to shaking the entire courtroom structure. The spectators bite off their words and sink frightened into their seats. We notice \"Q\" throwing a glance toward Picard to see if the Captain is properly impressed. Then the \"bench\" is lowered to allow \"Q\" to face Picard again. \"Q\" (JUDGE) (continued) Continuing these proceedings, I must caution you that legal trickery is not permitted. This is a court of fact! 55 CONTINUED: PICARD (same words; same time) ... court of fact! (nods) We humans know our past, even when we\\'re ashamed of it. I recognize this court system as the one which agreed with Shakespeare\\'s suggestion -- \"Kill all the lawyers\". \"Q\" (JUDGE) (nods) Which humans did. PICARD Which led to the rule: \"Guilty until proven innocent\". \"Q\" (JUDGE) Of course. Bringing the innocent to trial would be unfair. (leaning in; voice amplified) YOU WILL NOW ANSWER TO THE GRIEVOUS SAVAGERY CHARGE AGAINST HUMANITY. PICARD We\\'ll be happy to answer specific charges. \"Grievous savagery\" could mean anything. \"Q\" (JUDGE) (interrupting) Obviously it means causing harm to fellow creatures! PICARD Such as you did when you froze a member of our bridge crew? Will you be joining us in the dock here? \"Q\" (JUDGE) You fool. Are you certain you want a full disclosure of human ugliness? (to Mandarin-Bailiff) So be it! Present the charges. Mandarin-Bailiff refers to his portable view screen, then steps forward and presents it for Picard\\'s examination. 55 CONTINUED: (2) MANDARIN-BAILIFF Criminal, you will read the charges to the court. Picard takes the parchment, glances through some amount of it. Then he looks up. PICARD I see no charges against us, your honor. \"Q\" (JUDGE) (pounds \"bench top\") Criminal, you are out of order! Soldiers move in, unslinging automatic weapons, of which the barrels of two of them are now placed against Troi\\'s and Data\\'s heads. FADE OUT. PART THREE FADE IN: 56 INT. \"Q\" COURTROOM - WIDE ANGLE Action continuing from where it ended. The gun barrels are now pressing even closer to Troi and Data\\'s heads as: \"Q\" (JUDGE) Soldiers... (indicates guns) ... you will press those triggers if this criminal answers with any word other than \"guilty\"... 57 CLOSER ANGLE The Soldiers CLICKING FIRING ACTION TO FULL COCK. \"Q\" turns to Picard. \"Q\" (JUDGE) Criminal, how plead you? Picard takes his time, looking to his people, the Soldiers holding the guns at their heads, then to \"Q\". He seems to be taking too much time, and one of them shifts his weight, the other begins grasping his weapon even more firmly. Then: PICARD Guilty... Picard\\'s people can\\'t help but show relief and even the soldiers lighten up their stance and their grip on the weapons, until: PICARD (continuing) ... provisionally so. Surprised by this \"add on\", the Soldiers begin bringing their guns in close again, looking for guidance to \"Q\" who looks like he could decide either way. After considering it for a moment: \"Q\" (JUDGE) The Court will hear the provision. 57 CONTINUED: PICARD We question whether this court is abiding by its own trial instructions. Do I have permission to have Commander Data repeat the record? \"Q\" (JUDGE) If this is legal trickery... PICARD Your own words, your Honor. (to Data) Exactly what followed his Honor\\'s statement that the prisoner would not be harmed? 58 EMPHASIZING DATA Taking a moment to consult his memory, then: DATA Yes, sir. The Captain has asked the question... (in Picard\\'s VOICE) \"Can we assume this will be a fair trial?\" (in Data VOICE) And in reply, the judge stated... 59 OTHER ANGLES as Data goes on. DATA (continuing in \"Q\"\\'s VOICE) \"Yes, absolutely equitable.\" \"Q\" (JUDGE) Unacceptable testimony, entirely unacceptable... ! 59 CONTINUED: PICARD If your Honor pleases, there is a simple way to clear up this disagreement. (waits until he has \"Q\"\\'s attention) We agree there is evidence to support the court\\'s contention that humans have been murderous and dangerous. (moves in closer to \"Q\") I say \"have been\" ... and therefore we will respectfully submit to a test of whether this is presently true of humans. \"Q\" (JUDGE) (suddenly alert) I see, I see. (an idea forming) And you petition the Court to accept you and your comrades as proof of what humanity has become. PICARD There should be many ways we can be tested. We have a long mission ahead of us... \"Q\" (JUDGE) Another brilliant suggestion, Captain. But your test hardly requires a \\'long mission\\'. (laughs) Your immediate destination offers more challenge than you can possibly imagine. Yes, yes, this Farpoint station will be an excellent test of human worth. Picard, like the others, is now becoming just a bit concerned. What does lie ahead of them on Farpoint Station? 60 ANGLE INCLUDING MANDARIN-BAILIFF with \"Q\" nodding to him as the Bailiff stands, raising his voice. MANDARIN-BAILIFF Stand respectfully. All present, respectfully stand! 61 WIDE ANGLE Spectators standing. Picard and his people coming to their feet too. 62 EMPHASIZING \"Q\" AND PRISONERS (OPTICAL) as \"Q\" moves his bench into position. \"Q\" (JUDGE) This trial is adjourned to allow the criminals to be tested. The Mandarin-bailiff LOUDLY CLANGS HIS BELL. MANDARIN-BAILIFF This honorable court is adjourned! There is a smile coming onto the face of \"Q\" as he turns to Picard. \"Q\" (JUDGE) Captain, you may find you are not nearly clever enough to deal with what lies ahead for you. It may have been better to accept sentence here. \"Q\" WAVES TOWARD THEM, PRODUCING THE BLINDING LIGHT EFFECT we\\'ve seen before -- and the EFFECT BECOMES: 63 INT. BATTLE BRIDGE Picard and the others now in their normal garb and at their regular stations, all beginning to register their realization of where they now are. 64 ANGLES EMPHASIZING DATA, TROI, AND TASHA Reacting to where they now find themselves. Data turns to the Ops position. DATA Uh... what is present course, Ops? The OPS OFFICER looks at Data, surprised. OPS (to Data) It\\'s exactly what the Captain ordered, sir. Direct heading to Farpoint Station. 64 CONTINUED: Data has reviewed his console readings during this, turns to Picard: DATA Confirm we are on that heading, sir. OPS (to Data) Know anything about Farpoint? It sounds like a fairly dull place. PICARD Actually, Ops, I\\'ve heard just the opposite. Picard, Data, Troi and Tasha exchange looks, then settle back. 65 EXT. SPACE - LONG SHOT - PLANET (OPTICAL) moving in on a yellowish ball of a planet glowing against the black backdrop of starry space in the reflected light of its sun. There is some cloud layer. At this distance, the planet\\'s land masses are vague and indistinct. RIKER\\'S VOICE Personal log, Commander William Riker, Star Date 42354.4, at Farpoint Station. 66 CLOSER - ON THE PLANETS AND THE USS HOOD (OPTICAL) An older class starship (the USS Hood) lies in geosynchronous orbit above the planet. RIKER\\'S VOICE ... U.S.S. Hood has dropped me off at Farpoint Station where I await the arrival of the new U.S.S. Enterprise... 67 CLOSER - ON THE OLD CITY/STATION (SPEC.FX) AN AERIAL VIEW of the small, obviously old Bandi city connected to the modern sprawling spaceport/station, both set in the middle of a harsh and forbidding landscape. This is Farpoint Station. CAMERA PUSHES IN on the Old City portion. 67 CONTINUED: RIKER\\'S VOICE ... to which I have been assigned as first officer. Meanwhile... 68 INT. OLD CITY CORRIDOR - PANNING RIKER Commander William T. Riker approaching the door leading to the office at Farpoint\\'s Administrator. RIKER\\'S VOICE ... I have been asked to visit the office of Farpoint Station\\'s Administrator. 69 INT. ZORN\\'S OFFICE - OLD CITY - DAY - ANGLE ON RIKER AND ZORN 69 Riker ENTERING, crossing to an elegant, unusually shaped desk where ZORN, the station Groppler (administrator) rises and (unused to handshaking) at first offers the wrong hand, then gets the procedure straightened out with MUMBLED APOLOGIES. As with all the Bandi, Zorn is tall, skinny, rather grey-looking -- appears to be sixtyish (as do all the Bandi, including the young ones.) ZORN I thought you might like to know, Commander Riker, that we\\'ve still no word from your vessel. But, I trust we have made your waiting comfortable? RIKER Luxurious is more like it. Would it seem ungrateful if I ask for some information? ZORN Anything! RIKER Fascinating how in the midst of an old city like this, you\\'ve built a completely modern tritanium and duraglass space station. Your energy supply must be as abundant as I\\'ve heard. 69 CONTINUED: ZORN Geothermal energy is the one great blessing of this planet. I\\'ll have all the details of that sent to your quarters. RIKER Thank you. But it still seems incredible how you\\'ve built this station so rapidly and so... so perfectly suited to our needs. Pushes a desk top bowl of fruit toward Riker. ZORN Would your care for an Earth delicacy, Commander? RIKER Well, if there\\'s an apple there... There isn\\'t and we can SEE that this disappoints Zorn. RIKER (looking up; continues) It doesn\\'t matter... what I was saying was... (sees something out of SCENE) Well, I\\'ll be damned! 70 CAMERA PANS RIKER as he steps to the far end of Zorn\\'s desk where ANGLE REVEALS a second bowl of fruit. Riker picks an apple from it. ZORN Ah... ah yes, there was another selection here... RIKER (perplexed) Zorn, I would have sworn it wasn\\'t here a moment ago. ZORN And does your failure to notice it make it unwelcome? (smiles) The same with Farpoint Station, Commander. (MORE) 70 CONTINUED: ZORN (Cont\\'d) We hope a few easily answered questions about it won\\'t make Starfleet appreciate it less. Riker eyes Zorn thoughtfully, then takes a bite out of the apple. He chews, then: RIKER I\\'m sure it won\\'t, sir. (raises apple up) And this is delicious. Thank you. (crossing to door) Good morning, Groppler Zorn. He is EXITING even as Zorn levers himself out of his own chair. ZORN Good morning. The door closes behind Riker, and Zorn turns around angrily. ZORN (continuing) You\\'ve been told not to do that. Why can\\'t you understand? It will arouse their suspicions. As he speaks, CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS TO REVEAL clearly that there is no one else in the room, nor does he appear to be speaking into any sort of communication device. He seems to be talking to the walls. ZORN (continuing) ... and if that happens, we will have to punish you. We will, I promise you. We must! No reply that we can hear. Is this man mad? CUT TO: 71 INT. FARPOINT FOYER In considerable contrast to Zorn\\'s old city office we just left, this structure has a \"starbase\" look with its dazzling tritanium and glass construction. The few people in sight are Starfleet personnel. ENTERING FOREGROUND are DR. BEVERLY CRUSHER and her fifteen-year-old son WESLEY. 71 CONTINUED: Like most other humans of this century, she doesn\\'t look her age. Although forty years old, she looks hardly more than thirty. Her attractiveness is underscored by a naturally provocative walk -- the woman can\\'t help it. This is counter-balanced by her quick intelligence and her professional knowledge and skill as a physician. Her son, Wes, has that same quick intelligence, multiplied by four. That lively brain is ensconced in the body of a perfectly normal boy with moderate good looks, a cheerful personality, but with considerable maturity for someone his age. 72 ANOTHER ANGLE Riker ENTERS SCENE behind them and hurries to catch up. He calls: RIKER Doctor Crusher... WESLEY Mother, it\\'s Commander Riker. Beverly slows, lets Riker walk along with them. We see that despite her attractive face and form, she is naturally dignified and a bit reserved with new acquaintances like Riker. RIKER And hello to you, Wesley. Enjoying Farpoint Station? WESLEY (happily) Yes, sir. Riker smiles at the boy. It\\'s clear he approves of this polite and likeable kid. Then he becomes aware that Beverly has not answered his greeting and is waiting. RIKER Saw you and thought I\\'d join your stroll, if I may. BEVERLY Actually, we\\'re about to do some shopping. Riker throws her a look. Is she rejecting the offer of his company? 72 CONTINUED: RIKER I\\'ve been meaning to visit the mall myself. If I\\'m welcome? BEVERLY Of course. She moves toward an exit door. Wes has been looking from one to the other of them, interested in what they\\'ve said... and not said. 73 INT. FARPOINT SHOPPING MALL - DAY The ANGLE suggests a covered, airy mall with flowers and trees -- many of them Earth types but with a scattering of alien vegetation too. It is a spacious walkway with a number of pleasant shops and booths. In b.g. we SEE Bandi natives of this world, a tall and greyish life form, quiet and overly polite. Beverly, Wesley and Riker move down a line of shops. 74 CLOSER - BEVERLY, WESLEY, RIKER as they walk, Wes continuing to eye the two adults. Then: WESLEY If you\\'re wondering about Mom, Mister Riker, she\\'s isn\\'t actually unfriendly. She\\'s just shy around men she doesn\\'t know. Beverly is startled; Riker amused. BEVERLY Wesley... ! (swallows her annoyance; to Riker) I believe that means he would like us to be friends. RIKER (grins) I\\'m willing, Doctor. (more serious) And although we\\'re not officially part of the Enterprise yet, I thought there might be something useful we could do while we wait. 74 CONTINUED: Beverly stops at a table in front of a shop selling exotic materials. The modest selections of cloth are lined up on the table, some draped for best effect. Beverly looks over them critically, feeling weight and texture. The Bandi SHOPKEEPER has stayed at the rear of the booth. BEVERLY \"Useful\"? How and what, Commander? RIKER Investigating some things I\\'ve noticed here, Doctor. The last was a piece of fruit... Beverly has frowned over a particularly pretty piece of material which she holds up for the shopkeeper to see. BEVERLY Would this be available in emerald green? The Bandi Merchant smiles, nods and takes the bolt of cloth INTO A SMALL CLOSED OFF AREA BEHIND. Wes watches the merchant go as Beverly turns to look at Riker appraisingly. BEVERLY (continuing) I\\'m sure, Commander, there are reasons for a first officer to want to demonstrate his energy and alertness to a new captain. But since my duty and interests are outside the command structure... The Bandi Merchant comes quickly with the bolt of cloth -- now emerald green -- interrupts Beverly by holding it up for her approval. RIKER Isn\\'t it nice he happened to have the right color? Beverly glances sharply at Riker, suppressing a somewhat chagrined look. 74 CONTINUED: (2) BEVERLY (to Merchant) Thank you. I\\'ll take the entire bolt. Charge it to Beverly Crusher, Chief Medical Officer, USS Enterprise. The Merchant nods, ticks the information off on a flat little gadget that dangles from his belt, hands her the bolt of cloth. 75 ANOTHER ANGLE - DOLLYING WITH BEVERLY, RIKER, WESLEY as they walk away, Riker enjoying the look that\\'s come onto her face over this incident. RIKER Let\\'s see, where were we? BEVERLY I was accusing you of inventing work in order to curry favor with your new captain. I apologize. WESLEY Finding the exact right color took him only about twelve seconds, Mom. They stop a little distance off and look back toward the shop. BEVERLY Maybe this is something Jean-Luc Picard will want looked into. RIKER Jean-Luc? You know Captain Picard? WESLEY (proudly) When I was little, he brought my father\\'s body home to us. Riker is startled but Beverly only smiles, fondly pats her son\\'s head. 75 CONTINUED: BEVERLY Yes, Wes, long, long ago. (to Riker) Shall we continue the walk? I\\'d like to know you better, Mister Riker. CUT TO: 76 INT. FARPOINT LOUNGE - DAY - ON GEORDI AND MARKHAM LT. GEORDI LaFORGE and ENSIGN SAWYER MARKHAM are in the small, comfortable lounge area. Markham is a likeable young man, enthusiastic, energetic. He is still inclined to shoot from the hip rather than consider before speaking, but he is a capable (and very new) graduate of the Academy. We SEE Geordi at first only from behind, and we may routinely register the fact he is black. MARKHAM Where is she? They say she\\'s never late -- not since the old burrhog took over the captain\\'s chair. RIKER\\'S VOICE You wouldn\\'t be talking about the Enterprise, would you, Ensign Markham? 77 WIDER ANGLE The two young men turn around sharply to find Riker has come up behind them. The most important thing we notice about Geordi is that he wears a strange flattish device (like futuristic goggles) over his eyes. Although he is technically blind, his head always turns toward the person speaking to him because he can, in fact, see as well or better than anyone through the use of the visual prosthesis. As they realize that Riker is a senior officer, both young men straighten to attention. GEORDI/MARKHAM Sir. Yes, sir. Riker smiles at the ingrained and traditional response of the recent Academy graduate. RIKER You can stand at ease, gentlemen. We\\'re not on the Enterprise yet. 77 CONTINUED: MARKHAM You know we\\'re assigned to her, sir. RIKER (extending his hand) Riker. I\\'m slated to be First Officer. (they shake hands) I read the service records on all new personnel on the trip out. Excellent academic record at Starfleet Academy, Mister Markham. MARKHAM Thank you, sir. RIKER And you, Mister LaForge. Captain Dreyer praised your performance on the Hood. Why did you request transfer to the Enterprise? GEORDI Who wouldn\\'t, sir? The biggest, newest, fastest starship in the fleet -- RIKER Commanded by the best burrhog in the fleet. Right, Mister Markham? MARKHAM (sheepishly) Yes, sir. RIKER (grins) I\\'ve already forgotten who used those words. GEORDI Shouldn\\'t we have heard something from her by now, sir? A BANDI WOMAN approaches: BANDI WOMAN Commander Riker? RIKER Yes? 77 CONTINUED: (2) BANDI WOMAN The Enterprise has been picked up on our monitors, sir. I should tell you, sir, it is only the Stardrive Section. All three crewman are surprised to hear this. RIKER (to Woman) What about the Saucer Module? BANDI WOMAN We\\'ve received no explanation, sir. But the captain signals that you\\'re to beam up immediately. GEORDI (to Markham) Our new captain doesn\\'t waste time. RIKER A good rule for all of us to follow, gentlemen. Riker touches his communicator. His VOICE now \\'treated\\' to indicate he is transmitting. (This will be standard communicator format.) RIKER (continuing) Enterprise, this is Commander Riker on Farpoint. Standing by to beam up. TRANSPORTER EFFECT (OPTICAL) FADE OUT. PART FOUR FADE IN: 78 EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL) The Enterprise stardrive module in orbit of the Farpoint planet. 0 INT. STARDRIVE TRANSPORTER ROOM - ANGLE ON PLATFORM (OPTICCAL) As Riker BEAMS IN. Lieutenant Tasha Yar of Security is there, waiting until Riker is fully materialized, then: TASHA Lieutenant Yar of Security, sir. Captain Picard will see you on the Battle Bridge. Riker was prepared to shake hands but Tasha is already leading the way toward the turbolift. 80 INT. TURBOLIFT As Riker follows her inside, she speaks quietly toward the controls: TASHA Battle bridge. The doors snap closed and the lift moves. Riker looks Tasha over, waiting, then: RIKER With the saucer gone, can I assume something interesting happened on your way here? TASHA I\\'ll let the captain explain, sir. 81 INT. BATTLE BRIDGE - ANGLE ON PICARD He is seated in the command chair with Data and a couple of other crewpersons at their stations. DATA We are cleared into the standard parking orbit, sir. 81 CONTINUED: PICARD (nods) Make it so. The bridge turbolift doors open, Riker ENTERS the bridge after Tasha, follows her to Picard. TASHA Commander Riker, sir. RIKER Riker, W.T., reporting as ordered, sir. Picard takes his time, looking Riker over and then offering his hand. PICARD I really didn\\'t expect to welcome you to half a starship, Riker. (to Tasha) Is the viewer ready? TASHA All set up, sir. PICARD (to Riker) We\\'ll first bring you up to date on a little... \"adventure\" we had on our way here, Commander. Then we\\'ll talk. TASHA (to Riker) This way, sir. True, Picard does not waste time. Tasha is already leading Riker toward a viewer at the aft section of the Battle Bridge. 82 ANGLE ON AFT VIEWER as Tasha motions Riker to the seat, turns the VIEWER ON. The VIEWER SHOWS A SHOT FROM EARLIER WHEN \"Q\" (ELIZABETHAN) HAD APPEARED AND IS TALKING TO Picard. The VOICES ARE FAINT and Riker leans in, riveting attention to the bridge record. 83 ANGLE ON PICARD AND DATA as the android officer turns toward the captain. 83 CONTINUED: DATA (interrupting) Message from the Saucer Module. It will arrive here in fifty-one minutes, sir. PICARD Inform them we\\'ll hook up as soon as they arrive. Picard stands, crosses past Tasha on his way to the turbolift. PICARD (to Tasha) Bring him to my Ready Room when he\\'s done there. Picard EXITS via turbolift. 84 ANGLE ON RIKER Where VIEWER SHOWS ANGLE ON THE \"Q\" GRIDWORK STRETCHES OVER THE HEAVENS, THEN SHOT OF \"Q\" (21st CENTURY). Riker TURNS AWAY FROM VIEWER TOWARD CAMERA as he looks at the crewpersons on the bridge. He speaks to no one in particular. RIKER He calls that \"a little adventure\"? 85 INT. BATTLE BRIDGE READY ROOM Picard at a viewer going over a rather complex screen of formulas. A KNOCK at the door, he turns the viewer off. PICARD Come. Riker ENTERS, crosses to where the captain indicates he\\'s to sit. He does so, looking at Picard. Then: RIKER Wow! PICARD (laughs, nods) Exactly. 85 CONTINUED: RIKER This \"Q\", sir... is he crazy? I mean, seriously? PICARD Seriously, does it really matter how we judge them? We\\'re dealing with something that can juggle starships as if they were pebbles. RIKER It\\'s a rather astonishing \"little adventure\" you\\'ve had, Captain. PICARD (snaps) The issue isn\\'t what we call it, Commander. The important thing is we can be dead certain... accent on dead... that \"Q\" wasn\\'t joking. We\\'re alive only because we were placed on \"probation\", a very serious kind of \"probation\". Over which we have heard a CHIME SOUND. PICARD (continuing) Go. DATA\\'S VOICE The Saucer Module is now entering orbit with us, sir. PICARD Acknowledged. Commander Riker will conduct a manual docking. Picard out. RIKER Sir? PICARD You\\'ve reported in, haven\\'t you? You are qualified? RIKER Yes, sir. PICARD Then I meant now, Mister Riker. Riker jumps to his feet, EXITS. CAMERA PANS to Picard whose expression now relaxes. He\\'s not too unhappy with what he\\'s seen of his new first officer so far. 86 EXT. SPACE - SAUCER SECTION, BATTLE SECTION (OPTICAL) As before, the Saucer Section is above and ahead of the battle section. The battle section is SLOWLY moving ahead toward the Saucer Section for link-up. 87 INT. BATTLE BRIDGE - FULL SHOT Riker at the conn, concentrating. Tasha and Data are studying him, privately evaluating this new man. DATA You say you will be doing this manually, sir? No automation? RIKER As ordered. 88 EMPHASIZING RIKER He\\'s making a couple of calculations, glancing up at the viewscreen. 89 ANGLE ON VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL) The rear end of the saucer is moving closer, but it is still high. 90 EMPHASIZING RIKER RIKER (to Data at Conn) Two percent rise. Up angle adjustment three degrees. Maintain docking speed. Ops and conn positions AD LIB repeats of Riker\\'s orders. 91 EXT. SPACE - SAUCER AND BATTLE SECTION (OPTICAL) The battle section is seen rising, angling forward slightly, still moving slowly toward the saucer. 92 INT. BATTLE BRIDGE - EMPHASIZING RIKER glancing at the O.S. viewscreen, works his console again. RIKER Level her out. Maintain docking speed. Docking crew, prepare for reconnection. 93 EXT. SPACE - ANGLE ON SAUCER AND BATTLE SECTION (OPTICAL) The two are level now, quite close together, the battle section still moving slowly forward. 94 INT. BRIDGE - ANGLE ON RIKER Riker looks up at the viewscreen again. 95 ANGLE ON VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL) The saucer looms in the viewscreen -- everything is level, the docking section is dead ahead -- we are still moving forward. 96 CLOSE ON RIKER He makes a couple of quick entries on his console. RIKER All stop. Her inertia should do the job now. 97 EXT. SPACE - SAUCER AND BATTLE SECTION (OPTICAL) The two glide together smoothly. 98 INT. BRIDGE - WIDE SHOT Riker hits a couple more tabs on his panel as: RIKER Rejoin lock-up... now. 99 EXT. SPACE - FINAL HOOK-UP (OPTICAL) The reverse of disconnecting SHOTS we saw earlier -- huge STARDRIVE SECTION and SAUCER MODULE MECHANISMS MAKING FINAL HOOK-UP. 100 EXT. ENTERPRISE IN ORBIT (OPTICAL) The docking complete. 101 INT. TURBOLIFT Riker with Data, Tasha, and others. The time this takes is indicative of the size of this new Enterprise. 101 CONTINUED: RIKER (V.O.) Enterprise log, First Officer entry. Ship\\'s modules rejoined, stardate 42354.71 with command now transferred back to the main bridge. Riker looks up to see Tasha is watching him. Then: TASHA Neatly done, sir. RIKER I don\\'t imagine many mistakes happen under Captain Picard. TASHA No sir, they don\\'t. 102 INT. BRIDGE As the turbolift arrives. Lt. Worf crosses toward it, intercepts Riker. WORF I\\'m Lieutenant Worf, sir. Captain Picard requests you come immediately to his quarters. Having had little more than a glance at this main bridge, Riker turns and re-enters the turbolift. 103 INT. PICARD\\'S CABIN Much larger and more comfortable than the small battle Ready Room we were in earlier. Picard is there, turning as he hears a KNOCK: PICARD Come! Riker ENTERS. PICARD (continuing) A fairly routine maneuver but you handled it quite well. RIKER Thank you, sir. I hope I show some promise. 103 CONTINUED: An exchange of looks between the two. Clearly, Riker is annoyed by this \"faint praise\" kind of welcome. Picard leads the way to a setting for coffee. PICARD Some coffee. RIKER No thank you, sir. PICARD (pours himself a cup) And now I have a kind of \"what sort of second-in-command have I inherited?\" question. RIKER Yes sir, I thought you might. There\\'s nothing disrespectful in Riker\\'s tone of voice, but he does leave an impression that he\\'s not to be walked on either. PICARD I noticed in your envelope that Captain DeSoto thinks very highly of you. One curious thing, however, you refused to let him beam down to Altair IV? RIKER In my opinion, sir, Altair IV was too dangerous to risk exposing the captain. PICARD I see. A captain\\'s rank means nothing to you. RIKER Rather the reverse, sir. A captain\\'s life means a great deal to me. PICARD Let me postulate something here, Mister Riker. Isn\\'t it just possible that you don\\'t get to be a starship captain without knowing when it\\'s safe to beam down or not? Isn\\'t it a little presumptuous for a first officer to second guess his captain\\'s judgment? 103 CONTINUED: (2) RIKER Permission to speak candidly, sir? PICARD Always. RIKER You\\'ve been a first officer yourself. You know that assuming that responsibility must, by definition, include the safety of the captain. I have no problem with following the rules you lay down. But under no circumstances will I compromise your safety. If you have a problem with that, sir, you can put me back on the Hood before she leaves. PICARD You don\\'t intend to back off that position? RIKER No, sir, I can\\'t. Picard takes another beat to study him carefully, then: PICARD One further thing... a special favor I have to ask of you. RIKER Anything, sir. PICARD Using the same kind of strength you showed with Captain DeSoto, I\\'d appreciate it if you can keep me from making an ass of myself with children. RIKER Sir? PICARD I\\'m not a family man, Riker, and yet, Starfleet has given me a ship with children aboard. RIKER (nods) Yes, sir. And families... 103 CONTINUED: (3) PICARD And I don\\'t feel comfortable with children. But, since a captain needs an image of \"geniality\" toward the little monsters, you\\'re to see that\\'s exactly what I project. RIKER Aye, sir. For the first time, Picard smiles, extending his hand. We see he\\'s surprisingly warm when he wants to be. Riker takes Picard\\'s hand for a firm and friendly handshake. PICARD Welcome to the Enterprise, Mister Riker. 104 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE as Riker steps out of the turbolift. He stops, takes in the size of his compared to the Battle Bridge. The Klingon Lieutenant is at the conn position. He turns, seeing Riker: WORF Yes sir, Commander? Riker crosses in, shakes hands. RIKER Thank you, Lieutenant. Is Commander Data on duty? WORF Commander Data is on a special assignment, sir. He\\'s using our shuttlecraft to transfer an admiral over to the Hood. RIKER An admiral? WORF He\\'s been aboard all day, sir, checking over medical layout. RIKER Why the shuttlecraft? Can he just beam over? 104 CONTINUED: WORF I suppose he could, sir. But the admiral\\'s a rather remarkable man. 105 INT. ENTERPRISE CORRIDOR - ANGLE AT INTERSECTION DATA\\'S VOICE But, sir, the transporter could have you on the Hood in a matter of seconds, Admiral. Data and the admiral ENTER SCENE at the intersection. The admiral is very old with an almost transparent look. ADMIRAL Have you got some reason to want my atoms scattered all over space? DATA No sir. But at your age, sir, I thought you shouldn\\'t have to put up with the time and trouble of a shuttlecraft. The admiral stops. Facing Data, he draws himself. up as straight as he can. His voice is crotchety and trembly -- and fiercely stubborn. ADMIRAL My age? Hold it right there, boy, what about my age? DATA Sorry, sir. If that subject troubles you... ADMIRAL Troubles me? What\\'s so damned troubling about not having died? How old do you think I am? DATA One hundred forty-seven years, Admiral. According to Starfleet records. ADMIRAL Explain how you remember that so exactly. DATA I remember every fact I am exposed to, sir. 105 CONTINUED: The admiral peers at him closely, scowling. ADMIRAL I don\\'t see any points on your ears, boy, but you sound like a Vulcan. DATA No, sir. I am an android. ADMIRAL (snorts) Almost as bad. DATA (at a loss, but still respectful) I thought it was generally accepted, sir, that Vulcans are an advanced and most honorable race. The admiral stares at him a moment, his severe blue eyes gentling and his feisty scowl fading. He pats Data\\'s sleeve and nods slightly. ADMIRAL They are, boy. They are. And also damned annoying at times. DATA Yes, sir. As they move away, Data gently assisting the old man: ADMIRAL This is a new ship, boy, but she\\'s got the right name. Remember that. DATA I will, sir. ADMIRAL You treat her like a lady. (beat, quietly) She\\'ll always bring you home... FADE OUT. PART FIVE FADE IN: 106 EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL) Both the Enterprise and the Hood in orbit close together. CAMERA ANGLE shows how much LARGER the Enterprise is. 107 INT. SICKBAY Beverly is wearing medical \"blue\" -- or whatever color Science personnel are going to be assigned. She steps toward a LARGE VIEWSCREEN which comes on, showing readouts indicative of the status of the ship\\'s medical facilities. BEVERLY Show me the results of Captain Picard\\'s most recent physical examination. The screen promptly BEGINS TO FLASH UP PRINTED INFORMATION, followed by X-Ray type shots, etc. Beverly studies it for awhile. PICARD\\'S VOICE Already at work, Doctor? 108 ANOTHER ANGLE As Beverly turns to find Captain Picard ENTERING. She nods in answer to his question. BEVERLY Yes, on a subject that\\'s very important to this mission, Captain. (unhurriedly to computer) Screen off. The screen GOES DARK. PICARD I wanted to say \"welcome aboard.\" 109 CLOSER ANGLE - BEVERLY AND PICARD As if they\\'re appraising each other, then: 109 CONTINUED: BEVERLY Thank you, Captain. PICARD And I thought I should talk to you very personally about your assignment here. 110 CLOSER TWO SHOT As Beverly nods, waits for him to continue. PICARD (continuing) I wanted you to know I protested your posting to the Enterprise. BEVERLY Oh? Do you consider me unqualified? PICARD Hardly. Your service record shows you exactly the kind of CMO I\\'d want. BEVERLY Then you must object to me personally. Has it to do with our last meeting? PICARD I\\'m trying to be considerate of your feelings, Doctor Crusher. For you to serve with a commanding officer who would continually remind you of such a terrible personal tragedy... BEVERLY (annoyed; snaps) If I had any objections to serving with you, I wouldn\\'t have requested this assignment, Captain. PICARD You requested this posting? He turns to exit. Beverly stirs, and her next words stop him. 110 CONTINUED: BEVERLY Captain. My feelings about my husband\\'s death will have no effect on the way I serve you, this vessel, or this mission. Picard gives it a moment\\'s thought, extends his hand. PICARD Then, welcome aboard, Doctor. I\\'m pleased to have you here. Beverly allows only a perfunctory handshake. BEVERLY Thank you. And now, if I can return to my duties... It is clear that Picard wanted to say more but she has neatly blocked any further conversation. PICARD (uncomfortably) Well... as I said, \"welcome Aboard\". She doesn\\'t respond further and he has no choice but to turn and exit. 111 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND HOOD IN ORBIT (OPTICAL) Again, EMPHASIZING the considerable difference in the sizes of the two starships as we SEE that the USS Hood is PULLING AWAY, LEAVING ORBIT. 112 INT. BRIDGE - ANGLE ON RIKER He is standing before the huge viewscreen. Behind him is the young Klingon, Worf, at the conn position with the rest of the bridge stations only nominally manned. Set in geosynchronous orbit over the planet, the Enterprise requires minimal monitoring at this time. 113 ANGLE ON TURBOLIFT DOORS They OPEN, and Picard steps out onto the bridge. PICARD Have you signaled the Hood, Mister Riker? 113 CONTINUED: RIKER (nods) Your exact message. (in French) Bon voyage mon amie. Aye, sir. 114 ANOTHER ANGLE - TO INCLUDE MAIN VIEWER as Picard smiles and steps toward it. PICARD And what was my answer, computer? MAIN VIEWER FLICKERS, then startles us with an ugly FLASH OF LIGHT that becomes an IMAGE OF \"Q\" (JUDGE) who is in LIMBO, but looking directly at Picard. His VOICE BOOMS LOUDLY, annoyed in tone: \"Q\" (JUDGE) DO YOU EXPECT ME TO WAIT PATIENTLY THROUGH ALL THIS NONSENSE? OR DID YOU THINK I WAS GONE? Picard is as startled as Riker. The young Klingon, Worf, comes tumbling out of the conn position, drawing his phaser and placing himself protectively between Picard and the threatening \"Q\" image. PICARD Do you intend to blast a hole through the viewer, Lieutenant? Worf apologetically puts his phaser away, lets Picard wave him aside. PICARD (continuing) If the purpose of this is to test human worth, your honor, you must let us proceed in a normal human way. \"Q\" (JUDGE) YOU ARE DILATORY! YOU HAVE TWENTY-FOUR HOURS! ANY FURTHER DELAY AND YOU RISK SUMMARY JUDGEMENT AGAINST YOU, CAPTAIN. A FLASH OF LIGHT and the main viewer returns to an image of the planet below. 115 ANOTHER ANGLE WORF Sorry, sir... RIKER No criticism. You reacted fast... PICARD ... but in a completely useless way. WORF I\\'ll learn to do better, sir. PICARD Of course you will. We\\'ve a long voyage ahead of us. Picard dismisses Worf with a flicker of a smile which takes the sting out of what he just said. RIKER (lowers voice) Hope you\\'re right, sir. About the long voyage ahead. Picard looks to main viewer as if checking that \"Q\" is truly gone. PICARD I hope so too. RIKER What do we do, sir? With them monitoring every move, every word... PICARD S.O.P., Mister Riker. RIKER Standard Operating Procedures? PICARD (nods) We do exactly what we\\'d do if this \"Q\" never existed. If we\\'re going to be damned, let\\'s be damned for what we really are. Riker is suddenly very pleased with this captain. He nods emphatically. FADE OUT. PART SIX FADE IN: 116 EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL) U.S.S. Enterprise in orbit of planet Cygnus IV. PICARD V.O. Captain\\'s log, stardate 42372.5. Of the twenty-four hours \"Q\" allotted us to prove ourselves... 117 INT. BRIDGE - ANGLE INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER Minimum bridge crew on duty. PICARD V.O. ... eleven have now passed without incident. And yet I cannot forget \"Q\\'s\" prediction that we will face here some critical test of human worth. 118 INT. BRIDGE READY ROOM Picard and Riker comparing notes. RIKER This planet\\'s interior heat results in abundant geothermal energy, sir. But it\\'s about all this world does offer. PICARD And it\\'s your belief that this is what made it possible for them to construct this base to Starfleet standards? RIKER Yes sir. We have to assume that they\\'ve been trading their surplus energy for the construction materials used here. According to our ship\\'s scans, many of the materials used are not found on this world. 118 CONTINUED: PICARD (smiles) Perhaps it\\'s like those incidents you describe in your report as \"almost magical\" attempts to please us. RIKER Those events did happen, sir. PICARD And in time we\\'ll discover the explanation. Meanwhile, none of it suggests anything threatening. If only every life form had as much desire to please Starfleet. (stands) Ready to beam down? I\\'m looking forward to meeting this Groppler Zorn. Picard is leading Riker to the cabin door. RIKER I\\'m convinced there\\'s more to it than just \"pleasing us\", sir. PICARD (as they exit) Like something \"Q\" is doing to trick us? 119 INT. BRIDGE As Picard and Riker enter from the adjoining Ready Room. Troi is just arriving in the turbolift and Picard calls to her. PICARD Over here, Counselor! (to Riker) I\\'ve asked her to join us in this meeting. (indicating) May I introduce our new first officer, Commander William Riker. Mister Riker, our ship\\'s counselor, Deanna Troi. 120 TWO SHOT - RIKER AND TROI He\\'s obviously stunned to find her here, although she isn\\'t at all surprised. TROI\\'S VOICE (carrying her thoughts) Do you remember what I taught you, Izmadi? Can you still sense my thoughts? Then, she holds out her hand formally. TROI A pleasure, Commander. RIKER (nervously) I, ah... likewise, Counselor. 121 ANGLE INCLUDING PICARD Studying the two of them with some curiosity now. PICARD (to Riker) Have the two of you met before? RIKER We... we have, sir. PICARD Excellent. I consider it important that my key officers know each other\\'s abilities. TROI We do, sir; we do. Meanwhile, Picard has indicated the turbolift and is leading them toward it. 122 EMPHASIZING TROI As she looks back toward Riker serenely. TROI\\'S VOICE (her thoughts) I, too, would never say goodbye, Izmadi. 123 EXT. FARPOINT STATION (OPTICAL) ESTABLISHING SHOT as: PICARD\\'S VOICE My crew and I need a bit more information... 124 INT. ZORN\\'S OFFICE Where Zorn sits behind his desk, his posture and attitude indicating some nervousness. Seated facing him are Picard, Riker, and Troi. We see that Zorn\\'s attention is on Troi. PICARD (continuing) ... before we make our recommendations to Starfleet. ZORN No objections to that, but... (eyeing Troi again) ... but I\\'m puzzled over your bringing a Betazoid to this. If her purpose here is to probe my thoughts, sir... TROI I can sense only strong emotions, Groppler. I am only half Betazoid; my father was a Starfleet officer. ZORN I have nothing to hide, of course. PICARD Good, since we admire what we\\'ve seen of your construction techniques. Starfleet may be interested in your constructing starbases elsewhere too. 125 ANGLE EMPHASIZING TROI As her expression begins to indicate an awareness of something distressing, something painful. During which: ZORN Unfortunately, Captain, we are not interested in building other facilities. 126 ANGLE EMPHASIZING PICARD AND RIKER This stumps Picard for a moment, during which: RIKER If I may, Captain... (gets a nod) Then a trade, Groppler? Some things you need in return for the loan of architects and engineers who can demonstrate your techniques. 127 EMPHASIZING ZORN ZORN We Bandi do not wish to leave our home world. If Starfleet cannot accept that small weakness, then we will be forced, unhappily, to seek an alliance with someone like the Ferengi, or... Zorn interrupted by a small GROAN coming from Troi. Her eyes are now closed over a strong distress she\\'s sensing. 128 VARIOUS OTHER ANGLES As appropriate. PICARD Counselor... ? What is it? TROI (glancing toward Zorn) Do you want it described here, sir? PICARD Yes! No secrets here if we\\'re all to be friends. (to Zorn) Agreed, Groppler? ZORN We ourselves have nothing to hide, but... 128 CONTINUED: TROI (another GROAN, grimacing) Pain... pain, loneliness, terrible loneliness, despair... (indicates Zorn) I\\'m not sensing him, sir. Or any of his people... but it\\'s something very close to this location. PICARD (to Zorn, demandingly) The source of this? Do you have any idea? ZORN No! (stands) No, absolutely not. And I find nothing helpful or productive in any of this! PICARD (stands, to Zorn) That\\'s it? No other comment? ZORN What do you expect form us? We offer a base designed to your needs, luxurious even by human standards... Riker and Troi come to their feet too as Picard interrupts. PICARD ... while refusing to answer even our simplest questions about it. (to Riker) We\\'ll adjourn for now... (to Zorn) ... while we all reconsider our positions. The three CROSS toward the exit. ZORN Captain, the Ferengi would be very interested in a base like this. PICARD Fine. I hope they find you as tasty as their other past associates. Picard and his people EXIT. 129 EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL) The U.S.S. Enterprise still in orbit over Cygnus IV. 130 INT. HOLODECK CORRIDOR Riker moving as if seeking someone. He intercepts a YOUNG ENSIGN who is passing and the junior officer sees Riker\\'s emblem of rank and snaps to attention. RIKER Ensign, can you help me find Commander Data? I was told he\\'s somewhere on this deck. YOUNG ENSIGN This way, sir. 131 ANGLE AT CORRIDOR WALL As the Ensign steps to a black surface of the corridor wall. YOUNG ENSIGN You must be new to these galaxy class starships, sir. (puts hand on the black surface, saying) Tell me the location of Commander Data. At the touch and the words \"Tell me\" the black surface comes alive with light patterns showing appropriate information. COMPUTER VOICE Lieutenant Commander Data... now located in Holodeck area 4-J. YOUNG ENSIGN (indicating readout) And as you see, sir, it\\'s pointing you that way. RIKER Go that way? How far? YOUNG ENSIGN (smiles) You\\'ll know, sir. Riker AD LIBS a thanks, goes in the indicated direction. 132 PANNING RIKER Moving off in the indicated direction. Then the black surface there comes alive with a FLASHING DIRECTION SIGNAL. COMPUTER VOICE This way, please. The next hatchway on your right. RIKER (responding automatically) Thank you... COMPUTER VOICE You\\'re more than welcome, Commander Riker. Which startles him a bit but he walks on and turns right at a sophisticated looking Holodeck Hatchway. 133 EXT. PARKLAND The Parkland hidden at this moment by a WILD SECTION OF CORRIDOR WALL AND HATCHWAY which, when the hatch is opened, will REVEAL PARKLAND. COMPUTER VOICE (continuing without delay) And if you care to enter, Commander... RIKER (snaps; interrupting) I do. Immediately, the hatch slides open and we SEE THE PARKLAND (LOCATION). It looks (and is) real, including land contours, trees, and even a small stream nearby. Beyond that the Parkland stretches off for what appears to be miles and miles away to the horizon. 134 ANGLE BACK TOWARD HATCHWAY As Riker ENTERS through it and stands inspecting the Parkland scene with genuine appreciation and then HEARS SOMEONE WHISTLING A MELODY, but doing it rather badly and laboriously. 135 ANGLE PAST RIKER INTO PARKLAND As he MOVES AWAY, seeking the source of the WHISTLING which will begin to grow LOUDER now. 136 ANGLE AT STREAM As Riker crosses, stepping from rock to rock. He makes a misstep, almost falls, then recovers and gets across. He looks back at the stone which caused it. 137 CLOSER ON RIKER As he walks, the WHISTLING is nearby now. He stops, calls: RIKER Hello! The WHISTLING has continued without pause, Riker cocks his ear, corrects his direction slightly. 138 EXT. WOODLAND GLEN Riker ENTERS SHOT through shrubbery, sees something and stops. 139 ANGLE ON DATA Lying there, cushioned by deep grass. He\\'s totally absorbed in certain melody notes he\\'s attempting -- and keeps missing. 140 PANNING RIKER Moving onto TWO SHOT where he stops, and WHISTLES the same melody, hitting the correct notes. A startled Data looks up blankly, then comes quickly to his feet, but Riker waves him back down, sits beside him. DATA Marvelous how easily humans do that, sir. I still need much practice. Riker, acting uncomfortable, avoids the subject. He hesitates, then: RIKER There are some puzzles down on the planet that Captain Picard wants answered. He suggests I put you on the away team I\\'ll be using. 140 CONTINUED: DATA I shall endeavor to give satisfaction, sir. Riker hesitates, wanting to say something but not sure how to begin. RIKER Uh, yes. And when the captain suggested you I, uh, looked up your record... (hesitates) DATA Yes sir, a wise procedure always. RIKER Your rank of lieutenant commander, I assume now must be honorary. DATA No, sir. Starfleet Class of \\'78; honors in quantum mathematics and exobiology. RIKER But your files... they say you\\'re a... DATA (waits, then) Machine? Correct, sir. Does that trouble you? RIKER (hesitates) To be honest... yes, a little. DATA Understood, sir. Prejudice is very human. RIKER Now that troubles me. Do you consider yourself superior to us? DATA I am superior in many ways. But I would gladly give it up to be human. RIKER (studies Data, then) Nice to meet you, Pinocchio, 140 CONTINUED: (2) Data seems confused by this. RIKER (continuing; explains) A joke. DATA (straight-faced) Ah! Intriguing. RIKER (big grin) You\\'re going to be an interesting companion, Mister Data. FADE OUT. PART SEVEN FADE IN: 141 EXT. PARKLAND - RIKER AND DATA We HEAR A VOICE (Wesley) and Riker gets to his feet, looks off in that direction. DATA This pattern is quite popular, sir. Perhaps because it duplicates Earth so well, Coming here, (apologetically) makes me feel as if I\\'m human too. RIKER (taking it all in) I didn\\'t believe these could be so real. DATA Much of it is real, sir. If the transporters can convert our bodies to an energy beam, then back to the original pattern again... RIKER Yes, of course. (indicates) And all these have much simpler patterns. 142 EXT. PARKLAND AT STREAM Data leading the way, then indicates. DATA The rear wall. RIKER (peers) I can\\'t see it. DATA You will. PANNING RIKER TOWARD US He\\'s squinting hard now. Then he stops, reacts at something he can now make out. RIKER Incredible! 143 INT. STAGE HOLODECK - ANGLE PAST RIKER (OPTICAL) As he hurries toward where we can now SEE the holodeck wall (REAR PROJECTION SCREEN) on which we can now SEE that the PARKLAND soil, rocks and vegetation blend with the PROJECTED IMAGE there. Astonished, Riker backs away from this, squinting again. 144 EXT. REAL PARKLAND - RIKER\\'S P.O.V. Where, of course, the wall blend is no longer visible. WESLEY\\'S VOICE (calling) Mister Riker, isn\\'t this great? MEDIUM ON RIKER Turning, then grinning, waving. RIKER\\'S P.O.V. - THE ROCK CROSSING AT STREAM Where Wes Crusher is hurrying toward us, bouncing from rock to rock. WESLEY This is one of the simpler patterns, Mister Riker. They\\'ve got thousands more, some you just can\\'t believe. ANGLE TO INCLUDE RIKER AND DATA Moving down the stream. RIKER Careful, that next rock is loose... ! WIDER ANGLE As that rock moves underfoot, tumbling Wes into the stream. PANNING DATA IN, demonstrating his enormous strength as he easily lifts Wesley completely out of the water. An amazed Wesley looks at Data. WESLEY Wow! 145 EXT. PARKLAND - ANGLE ON WILD HATCHWAY AND CORRIDOR SECTION As the hatchway smoothly SLIDES OPEN AGAIN. Through it is REVEALED THE PARKLAND, through which Riker, Data and a very wet Wesley make their way to the HATCHWAY. As they MOVE THROUGH HATCHWAY, the bulkhead BEGINS CLOSING. 146 INT. HOLODECK CORRIDOR - ANGLE ON CAPTAIN PICARD The Captain walking with a Senior Officer when he sees Riker and the others. He motions the Senior Officer to continue on by himself, stops and waits. VARIOUS ANGLES - AS APPROPRIATE As Riker, Data and Wes move INTO SHOT with Picard. Wes is instantly aware that his soaked clothing is dripping water onto the starship deck. He\\'d like to remove himself but knows that Picard has already seen his puddle forming on the deck. RIKER Mister Data has agreed to join my away team, Captain. PICARD (with another glance toward Wes\\'s puddle) Very good. WES Sir, maybe I should get something to wipe this water up. PICARD (coolly) Good idea. Picard turns and EXITS. 147 INT. SICKBAY - BEVERLY AND WESLEY Wesley is wiping himself dry now. He is enthusiastically trying to explain his adventures. WESLEY -- and there\\'s a low gravity gymnasium, too. It would be hard to get bored on this ship. 148 CLOSER TWO SHOT - BEVERLY AND WESLEY As he wipes, he\\'s been turning something over in his mind. WESLEY Mom... (beat) could you get me a look at the bridge? BEVERLY That\\'s against the captain\\'s standing orders. WESLEY Are you afraid of the captain, too? BEVERLY I certainly am not! WESLEY But Captain Picard is a pain, isn\\'t he? BEVERLY Your father liked him very much. Great explorers are often lonely, ... no chance to have a family... WESLEY Just a look, at the bridge, Mom. From the turbolift when the doors open. I wouldn\\'t get off. I promise. BEVERLY You\\'re looking for trouble, Wes. He shuts up. Beverly looks at him and can\\'t ignore the very real want in his eyes. BEVERLY (continuing) Let\\'s see what we can do. On Wes\\'s delighted grin: CUT TO: 149 EXT. FARPOINT STATION/CITY - DAY - EMPHASIZING STATION TO ESTABLISH our location. 150 INT. STATION SHOPPING AREA - DAY - ON AWAY TEAM Which is made up of Riker, Data, Troi, Tasha and Geordi. There are a number of people in the mall area, some in identifiable Enterprise-type uniforms. The others are in various civilian clothes. They are taking in the Bandi shops, booths, food and drink offered by Bandi vendors. TASHA Recommend that someone could begin by examining the underside of the station, sir. TROI Our sensors do show some passages down there, sir. Perhaps you and I? Troi glances at Riker with just a shade of archness, perhaps the lift of an eyebrow. Riker glances away, troubled. RIKER Tasha, you and the Counselor. Troi and Tasha move off. Riker turns to Geordi. RIKER Let\\'s us start with the topside. Have you noticed anything unusual? Riker and the others move out of scene, examining everything they pass. DISSOLVE TO: 151 INT. ANOTHER STATION AREA ON GEORDI as he looks around the area, moving slowly and carefully scanning. Then he shakes his head. GEORDI Well, I can\\'t see through solid matter, sir, but the material so far looks very ordinary. DATA Confirmed by the construction records, sir. Almost exactly the same material that Starfleet uses. Riker reaches to his insignia, to switch on his communicator. 151 CONTINUED: RIKER Riker to Tasha, Troi, come in! We milk the next few moments, Riker growing apprehensive. Then, finally, with Riker showing relief: TASHA\\'S VOICE (from communicator) We were about to call you, Team Leader. We\\'ve found something interesting. 152 INT. UNDERGROUND PASSAGEWAY Not at all what one would expect of a \"service tunnel\", if this is indeed that. These are smooth, rounded, glistening walls whose GLOW lights up the entire passageway. (We\\'ll see something similar later on a mystery vessel). Tasha is activating her communicator. TASHA We\\'re in a passageway directly under the station sir. But the tunnel walls here are make from something we\\'ve never seen before. RIKER\\'S VOICE And Troi, have you sensed anything there? Troi appears reluctant as she activates her communicator. TROI Sir, I\\'ve avoided opening my mind. Whatever I sensed in the Groppler\\'s office became very painful. RIKER I\\'m sorry, Counselor, but you must. We need more information. Troi complies... then her face contorts in agony and a SMALL SCREAM ESCAPES. She sinks to her knees, Tasha hurrying in to support her. TROI (continuing) No, no, such pain. It\\'s so close to us here... pain, pain.. 152 CONTINUED: RIKER\\'S VOICE (overlapping) Hang on, I\\'m coming... Enterprise, lock us onto her signal! Tasha has her arm around Troi, whispering words of comfort. 153 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL) After a moment, the familiar TRANSPORTER SOUND BEGINS. Riker, Data, and Geordi BEAM IN, SOLIDIFY. Then Riker hurries over to Troi while Data and Geordi examine their surroundings with great curiosity. 154 ANGLE ON TROI Riker helping her very tenderly: RIKER I\\'m sorry. Close your mind from the pain... TROI It\\'s also unhappiness... terrible despair... RIKER Who? TROI I don\\'t know! No lifeform anything like us. Riker is looking around at the glowing walls. RIKER What in the hell kind of place is this? (turning) Geordi, what do you see? Geordi has been inspecting the wall closely. He shakes his head. GEORDI It\\'s of no material I recognize, sir. Or have even heard of. 155 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL) As before, in geosynchronous orbit. 156 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE - ANGLE ON PICARD in the captain\\'s chair. The bridge is nominally manned at this time. We will see Worf at the ops panel. Picard glances around as the SOUND OF THE TURBOLIFT DOORS OPENING COMES OVER, and he freezes. 157 PICARD\\'S P.O.V. - BEVERLY AND WESLEY standing just inside the turbolift door. Beverly is uncomfortable; Wes is all eyes, taking in as much as he possibly can in this one limited look at his dream place. Beverly starts to step out, gesturing to Wes to stay in the turbolift. BEVERLY Permission to report to the captain... 158 WIDER ANGLE - INCLUDING PICARD, BEVERLY PICARD (coolly) Children are not allowed on the bridge, Doctor. BEVERLY Captain, my son is not on the bridge. He merely accompanied me on the turbolift. PICARD Your son? BEVERLY His name\\'s Wesley. You last saw him years ago when... She trails her words; Picard understands. PICARD Oh, back then. He glances from Beverly to Wesley, clears his throat. PICARD (continuing) Well -- as long as he\\'s here... 159 WIDER - INCLUDING WESLEY, BEVERLY, PICARD Wesley looks to Picard hopefully. Beverly waits, then Picard shrugs, tries to sound friendly. 159 CONTINUED: PICARD I knew your father, Wesley. Want a look around? Wesley is out like a shot. PICARD (continuing; quickly) But don\\'t touch anything! Wes is in awe. To him, this is the equivalent of a devout Catholic stepping into the nave of St. Peter\\'s Basilica. The turbolift is on the level of the \"horseshoe\", so the command positions are spread below him. Picard moves down to the captain\\'s chair level, Wes moving with him. He is careful to put his feet down just right so he doesn\\'t even scuff the floor. Picard watches, steps aside to gesture toward the command chair. PICARD (continuing) Try it out. (as Wes does so) The panel on your right is for log entries, library-computer access and retrieval, viewscreen control, intercoms, and so on. WESLEY (nodding; pointing) Yes sir. And here, the backup conn and ops panels, plus armament and shield controls. Picard looks closely at Wes, perplexed. PICARD The forward viewscreen is controlled by the ops position... WESLEY Yes sir, which uses high resolution, multi-spectral imaging sensor systems... PICARD How the hell do you know that, boy? Before Beverly or Wes can reply, a VERY DISTINCTIVE SIGNAL SOUNDS (Captain\\'s comm signal) and Wes, closest to the control, transfers the signal into audio as: 159 CONTINUED: (2) WES Perimeter alert, Captain! Wesley is instantly embarrassed; Beverly is mortified; Picard is ang7ry. WES BEVERLY I\\'m sorry. I didn\\'t mean Wes! You shouldn\\'t to... have touched anything... PICARD Off the bridge! Both of you. Worf has come to his feet, not sure whether or not he should respond to the call. Beverly is hustling Wesley toward the turbolift. WORF You have a perimeter alert, Captain. BEVERLY (to Picard) As my son tried to tell you! She EXITS into the turbolift, the doors CLOSING behind her and Wesley. Picard, slamming his fist into his other palm, jumps for his command chair as: PICARD Picard. Go ahead. SECURITY VOICE Ship\\'s sensors have detected the presence of a vessel approaching this planet. No ship is scheduled to arrive at this time. PICARD Have Mister Riker, and his team beamed back up! Security, could that be the Hood returning here? SECURITY VOICE The vessel does not match the Hood\\'s configuration or I.D. signal. PICARD Put it on main viewer! 160 ANGLE ON VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL) Instantly, the image of a ship is flashed on the screen. It appears big, dark, ominous -- even at far range -- and it is approaching very swiftly. 161 ANGLE ON PICARD AND WORF PICARD Identification? SECURITY VOICE Vessel unknown, configuration unknown, sir. PICARD Hail it! WORF (works his panel) We\\'ve been trying, sir. No response. PICARD Raise all shields, phasers at ready. WORF (works panel) Shields up, sir. Phasers ready. (turns to Picard) Could this be that \"Q\" you mentioned, sir? 162 CLOSE ON PICARD staring at the viewscreen. PICARD I almost hope so, Lieutenant. We face too many \"unknowns\" already. 163 ANGLE ON VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL) The ship is closer now -- looks menacing -- and still coming fast. FADE OUT. PART EIGHT FADE IN: 164 EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL) The Enterprise in orbit. 165 INT. BRIDGE - WIDE ANGLE All bridge positions are filled now, everyone watching the viewscreen intently. 166 ANGLE ON VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL) The mystery vessel approaching closer. 167 PICARD AND WORF PICARD Continue universal greeting on all frequencies. Get me Groppler Zorn. There is a BEEP, a pause, then: ZORN\\'S VOICE This is Zorn, Captain. 168 INT. ZORN\\'S OFFICE - DAY - ON ZORN He is seated at the desk, speaks into a small portable communicator grid shaped to fit the palm of his hand. PICARD\\'S VOICE There is an unidentified vessel moving into orbit with us. Do you know who it is? 169 INTERCUT BETWEEN ZORN AND PICARD AS NEEDED. ZORN There are no ships scheduled to arrive until -- PICARD I asked if you know who it is, Groppler. You mentioned the Ferengi Alliance to me. 169 CONTINUED: ZORN (very nervous) But we have had no dealings with them. It was only a... a thought. PICARD Are you very, very certain of that, Groppler? ZORN I promise you we were making an empty threat, Captain. I wanted your cooperation. Forgive me -- WORF Definitely entering an orbital trajectory, sir. SECURITY POSITION It measures half again our size, Captain. 170 EXT. SPACE - ANGLE ON MYSTERY VESSEL/ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL) The mystery vessel approaches and settles into geosynchronous orbit. It is positioned slightly above and to the side of the Enterprise -- and it is a great deal larger than the Enterprise. Suddenly, A GLOWING PULSE OF LIGHT throbs out from the mystery vessel toward the Enterprise. 171 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE - FULL SHOT The LIGHT GLOWS OVER EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE ON THE BRIDGE. They are startled by it, but no one is hurt. As the GLOW FADES AWAY: PICARD All stations, give any damage reports. The others are looking at each other, shaking their heads. No problems. WORF I would guess we were being scanned, sir. 172 INT. UNDERGROUND PASSAGEWAY Troi is leaning against the strange, smooth and shining tunnel wall as if still feeling pain. Riker, obviously still concerned for Troi, is examining the strange tunnel walls with the tricorder while Geordi moves his \"eyes\" inches away from the surface to examine it closely. Data is testing his communicator and we\\'ll HEAR him trying to get a signal back from the Enterprise. TASHA (to Troi) Pain again? RIKER (turning; sharply) Troi, you\\'ve been at it enough! TROI No, I feel close to an answer of some kind. DATA (interrupting) Commander, something down here is shielding our communicators. TROI (comes to her feet) Yes, that\\'s exactly the feeling I\\'ve been reading. As if someone doesn\\'t want us to be in touch with our ship. RIKER Come on... (leads the way) ... let\\'s get to the surface. 173 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND MYSTERY VESSEL (OPTICAL) The mystery vessel clearly larger than the Enterprise and moving near it in orbit. 174 INT. BRIDGE - INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL) On which is featured an IMAGE OF MYSTERY VESSEL. OPERATIONS POSITION There is no computer record of any such vessel, sir. Not even close. 174 CONTINUED: SECURITY POSITION Still no response, sir. We\\'ve done everything but threaten them. PICARD Sensor scans, Mister Worf. WORF Our sensor signals seem to just bounce off. (bites off words; indicates to viewer) Something\\'s happening, sir... 175 FULL ON MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL) As a beam of something STRIKES DOWNWARD TOWARD THE PLANET SURFACE. (It doesn\\'t look exactly like the Enterprise phasers but is the same sort of thing.) 176 EXT. SPACE - ANGLE ON MYSTERY VESSEL (OPTICAL) As another phaser-like BEAM STRIKES DOWN AT THE PLANET. 177 INT. BRIDGE Excitement. 178 ANGLE ON OPS POSITION WORF They\\'re firing on Farpoint, sir... ! PICARD (toward Security position) Bring phasers and photon torpedoes to ready! WORF No, hold it, sir. They\\'re hitting the Bandi city, not Farpoint Station. 179 INT. UNDERGROUND PASSAGEWAY Riker and his team racing to where the rounded, smooth and shining walls of the tunnel begin to give way to a more ordinary looking rectangular corridor of mixed stone and tile walls. 180 ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING STAIRWAY AHEAD Riker pulling to a halt in order to examine with curiosity the blend where the unknown type tunnel walls give way to stone and tile construction similar to what we\\'ve seen in the old Bandi city. Ahead is a stone block stairway leading up to that old city. Geordi has hurried in, peering closely at the more familiar kind of wall surface. TROI (indicates ahead) Those stairs are where Tasha and I entered down here, sir. GEORDI At this point, it becomes ordinary stone and tile, sir. (turns, puzzled) Matching what\\'s above. Followed by a LONG RUMBLING EXPLOSION (\"PHASER HIT\" type) WITH THE LONG FLASH OF IT REFLECTING DOWN THE STAIRWAY FROM THE UPPER LEVEL AHEAD. As this SOUND FADES, then we HEAR A FAINT DISTANT SCREAM which dies away too. TASHA My God! Was that a phaser blast? DATA Negative. But something similar. Again, the SAME KIND OF EXPLOSION SOUND followed by similar LIGHT FLICKERS from the stairway ahead. Riker turns to Troi: RIKER You, Tasha, and Geordi will beam up to the ship from here. Now! (to Data) Come on, I want to see exactly what\\'s happening. Riker starts off to the stairway, Data following. TROI Don\\'t. If you should be hurt... A stern look comes over Riker\\'s face as he turns quickly to her: RIKER You have your orders, Counselor! Carry them out! 180 CONTINUED: TROI Yes sir, I\\'m sorry, sir. 181 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL) Riker and Data begin climbing the stairway, leaving the CAMERA CENTERED ON TROI, TASHA AND GEORDI. Troi has already reached for her communicator control. TROI Enterprise, three to beam up. After a moment, the familiar TRANSPORTER SOUND, followed by TRANSPORTER EFFECT ON THE THREE DISSOLVING INTO THE LIGHT SPARKLE. Then, they\\'re gone. 182 INT. COVERED VILLAGE SQUARE (OPTICAL) OLD CITY IN IN B.G. where FIRE RAGES in a smashed structure in that part of the old city we can see. In CLOSER FOREGROUND is an entrance to the underground passageway, this entry guarded by thick, hand-worked metal door, locked. This village square is a connecting point between the Old City and Farpoint Station. A short distance in the OFF-CAMERA DIRECTION lies Farpoint Mall. 183 THE METAL DOORS (OPTICAL) We HEAR a hand phaser HUM as a GLOW FLICKERS OVER THE METAL DOORS which now spring open and a CLASHING OF METAL SOUND. Riker and Data ENTER SCENE though those door, phasers in hand. 184 CLOSER - RIKER AND DATA As Riker touches his communicator control. RIKER Enterprise, Riker. Come in. 0T INTERRUPTED BY THE CLOSER SOUND OF A PHASER-LIKE BOLT FROM THE MYSTERY VESSEL. Also from closer, THE LIGHT OF THE BLAST REFLECTS ON THEIR FACES and they whirl to see: 186 ANGLE INTO OLD CITY Where a building is being BLASTED INTO STONES AND DUST. 187 INT. ZORN\\'S OFFICE - OLD CITY Filled with the dust and SOUNDS of a nearby BLAST. Zorn is working frantically with his communicator. ZORN Enterprise, Enterprise, help us! Come in, please... 188 INT. BRIDGE - WIDE ANGLE (OPTICAL) On MAIN VIEWER THE IMAGE OF THE mystery vessel which as we watch will FIRE ANOTHER PHASER-LIKE BOLT DOWN TOWARD THE PLANET. The bridge crew are anxiously poised on the edge of their seats, waiting for Picard\\'s next order. ZORN\\'S VOICE ... what shall we do? Help us, please. PICARD (overlapping) Tune him down! (into transmitter) Commander Riker, go ahead. Where are you? 189 ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING TURBOLIFT As the doors SNAP OPEN TO REVEAL TROI, TASHA, AND GEORDI who hurry onto the bridge, take their regular positions (Geordi relieving Ops). Meanwhile: RIKER\\'S VOICE With Data, on the edge of the old city, Captain. It\\'s being hit hard. Who\\'s doing this? PICARD And Farpoint Station? Any damage there? 190 INT. COVERED VILLAGE SQUARE - FARPOINT MALL IN B.G. No indication that Farpoint Station has been damaged at all. Riker, standing with Data, is using his communicator. 190 CONTINUED: RIKER Negative on damage to Farpoint, sir. Whoever they are, it seems they\\'re carefully avoiding hitting the station. PICARD\\'S VOICE It\\'s from an unidentified vessel that\\'s entered orbit with us here. No ID, no answer to our signals... During which there\\'s another BLAST SOUND with the same kind of LIGHT FLICKERS. 191 ANGLE INCLUDING OLD CITY As Riker whirls again in that direction, interrupting Picard: RIKER They\\'re hitting the Bandi city hard, sir. Many casualties very probable. 192 INT. BRIDGE - EMPHASIZING PICARD Everything as we last left it. PICARD (into transmitter) Understand, Commander. Would you object to a clearly illegal kidnapping assignment? RIKER\\'S VOICE No objection; anything you order, sir. PICARD Zorn may have the answers we need. Get Groppler Zorn and bring him here! RIKER\\'S VOICE Aye, sir! 193 ANGLE INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL) Picard looks at the IMAGE of the huge mystery vessel still in orbit nearby. Picard turns to Troi: 193 CONTINUED: PICARD They\\'re forcing a difficult decision on me, Counselor. TROI (nods) But, I doubt protecting the Bandi would violate the Prime Directive. True, they are not actual allies... PICARD But we are in the midst of diplomatic discussions with them. (turns to Tasha) Lock phasers on that vessel, Lieutenant. 194 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL) In b.g., Tasha touching panel controls. TASHA Phasers locked on, Captain. Anything further INTERRUPTED BY OPTICAL EFFECT, the BLINDING LIGHT FLASH we\\'ve seen before and FADING TO REVEAL \"Q\", wearing the Judge\\'s costume from the earlier courtroom sequence. He is standing in front of Picard. \"Q\" (JUDGE) Typical, so typical. Savage lifeforms never follow even their own rules. FADE OUT. PART NINE FADE IN: 195 EXT. BRIDGE - EMPHASIZING PICARD AND \"Q\" Rather than being nervous over the arrival of \"Q\" (JUDGE), Picard has become coldly angry. PICARD Get off my bridge! 196 ANOTHER ANGLE \"Q\" stepping toward Picard, smiling sadly. \"Q\" (JUDGE) Also interesting, that order about phasers. TASHA (ignoring \"Q\"; to Picard) Still standing by on phasers, Captain. \"Q\" (JUDGE) (turning to Picard) Please don\\'t let me interfere. Use your weapons. PICARD You\\'re the one who has a lot to learn, \"Q\". With no idea of who\\'s on that vessel, my order was a routine safety precaution. \"Q\" (JUDGE) (breaking into LAUGHTER) Really? No idea of what it represents? The meaning of that vessel is as plain as... (then taps his nose) ... as plain as the noses on your ugly little primate faces. 196 CONTINUED: LOUDER LAUGHTER. \"Q\" (JUDGE) (trying to control it) And if you were truly civilized, Captain, wouldn\\'t you be doing something about the casualties happening down there? In answer, Picard touches the communications control on his uniform. PICARD Captain to CMO, are you reading any of this? 197 INT. SICKBAY - ANGLE EMPHASIZING BEVERLY But she\\'s with a half dozen MEDICAL ASSISTANTS very busy preparing medical supplies, bringing portable medical equipment, etc. BEVERLY Medical teams already preparing to beam down, Captain. PICARD\\'S VOICE (relieved) Compliments on that, Doctor! 198 INT. BRIDGE Picard turning back to \"Q\". PICARD Any questions? Starfleet people are trained to render aid and assistance whenever... \"Q\" (JUDGE) (interrupting) But not trained in clear thinking. PICARD Let\\'s consider your thoughts. You call us \"savages\" and yet you knew those people down there would be killed. You\\'re the one whose conduct is uncivilized. WORF Sir, they\\'re firing on the planet again. 199 ANGLE INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL) Where we SEE the mystery vessel beginning to FIRE BLASTS down at the planet again. PICARD Forcefields full on. (to Worf) Go to thrusters! Position us between that vessel and the planet. WORF Aye, sir, thruster power to... Worf trails his words, perplexed. His panel is fading, GOING DARK. WORF (continuing) We have no ship control, sir. It\\'s gone! 200 INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE ZORN\\'S OFFICE - DAY - RIKER AND DATA They are headed toward Zorn\\'s office door when the BLUE BOLT HITS beside the door, flooding the scene with a FLASH OF BLUE LIGHT. The corridor rocks, and the ceiling comes down partially. Riker and Data are flung down by the explosion. A beat, and then Data stirs, sits up. Riker is slower, but is managing to haul himself upright. DATA Are you undamaged? RIKER Yes. You? Data\\'s eyes glaze slightly as he seems to go into a sort of \"trance\" that lasts just a few seconds. Then: DATA All systems operating. 201 ANGLE INCLUDING ZORN\\'S OFFICE DOOR It is hanging by its hinges, and debris-dust is drifting out of it. Riker and Data move quickly to and through the open door. 202 INT. ZORN\\'S OFFICE - DAY - FULL SHOT As Riker and Data ENTER. The office has been badly damaged, especially near the door. O.S. THE SOUND OF ANOTHER BOLT EXPLODING echoes. The room shakes under the impact. There is a MUFFLED SOB near the desk. 203 CLOSER ANGLE - NEAR DESK Zorn is cowering under his elegant desk, shaking and sobbing in fear. ZORN Please. You can make it stop. Drive it away. RIKER Drive who away, Groppler? Zorn reacts as if he knows he\\'s said too much. ZORN I don\\'t know. DATA Unlikely, sir. (to Zorn) Our records show that you supervised all Bandi contact with other worlds... ZORN We haven\\'t done anything wrong! RIKER Then if we can learn nothing from you, perhaps we\\'ll leave. ZORN (frightened) No! No, don\\'t leave, I\\'ll try to explain some of... 204 EMPHASIZING ZORN (OPTICAL) A kind of TRANSPORTER SOUND is heard, and then a TRANSPORTER EFFECT, somewhat different from the Starfleet variety, centers on Zorn. He beging SCREAMING as he FADES FROM VIEW. 205 ANGLE ON RIKER As he keys his communicator. 205 CONTINUED: RIKER First officer to Enterprise. PICARD\\'S VOICE Go ahead, Riker. RIKER We\\'ve lost Zorn, sir. Something like a transporter beam, it snatched him out of here. 206 INT. BRIDGE \"Q\" still in the captain\\'s seat, listening to: RIKER\\'S VOICE Question, sir, could it have been the \"Q\" character you met earlier. \"Q\" (JUDGE) (laughs) None of you know who it is? You\\'re running out of time, Captain. 207 ANGLE EMPHASIZING PICARD AND TROI She\\'s frowning, trying to \\'feel\\' something. TROI Captain... Suddenly I\\'m sensing something else. It\\'s satisfaction, enormous satisfaction. PICARD From the same source as before? TROI No, that was on the planet. (indicates) This seems to be from here. 208 ANGLE TO INCLUDE MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL) And the image of the mystery vessel. 208 CONTINUED: \"Q\" (JUDGE) (to Troi) Excellent, Counselor! (indicates Picard) He\\'s such a dullard, isn\\'t he! INTERCOM VOICE Captain from Transporter Room. First officer and Mister Data now beaming aboard. \"Q\" (JUDGE) Excellent also! (to Picard) Perhaps with more of these little minds helping, you\\'ll... 209 EMPHASIZING PICARD As he whirls suddenly on \"Q\". PICARD (interrupting) That is enough, damn it! \"Q\" (JUDGE) We have an agreement; have you forgotten... ? In b.g., the turbolift doors SNAP OPEN but unnoticed by Picard and \"Q\" as they continue their argument. Riker and Data appear, move onto bridge as: PICARD We have an agreement which you are at this moment breaking by taking over our vessel, interfering with my decisions! (steps up nose-to-nose) You are not welcome on my bridge. Now, either leave or finish us. One of the two! \"Q\" stands, during which we have the impression that everyone is holding his breath. Then: \"Q\" (JUDGE) (gently) Temper, temper, mon capitaine. I am merely trying to assist a pitiful species. Perhaps I\\'ll leave if Mister Riker provides me with some amusement. 209 CONTINUED: PICARD (to Riker) Do nothing that he asks! \"Q\" (JUDGE) But I ask so little. And it is so necessary if you are to solve all this. (turns; indicates vessel image in Main Viewer) Beam over there with your... what is it called... your \"away team\"? (to Picard) You should already know what you\\'ll find there. But perhaps it was too adult a puzzle for you. RIKER Captain, with all respect, I intended to suggest beaming over there. 210 EMPHASIZING \"Q\" (OPTICAL) Amused at all this. He turns from Riker to look at Picard. \"Q\" (JUDGE) You show promise, my good fellow. PICARD But you don\\'t. You should have long ago realized that, humanity is NOT a criminal race! \"Q\" (JUDGE) YOU MUST STILL PROVE THAT! A familiar BLINDING FLASH, and then \"Q\" is gone. 211 ANGLE EMPHASIZING PICARD AND RIKER Realizing \"Q\" is gone, turning to look at each other. Riker checks a reading on his panel. RIKER Of the 24 hours \"Q\" gave us, we have less than one left, sir. 211 CONTINUED: PICARD (nods) But I had a feeling you impressed him, Number One. That\\'s hopeful. RIKER Thank you, Captain, That\\'s the first time you\\'ve called me \"Number One\". PICARD (small smile) I believe I\\'ll enjoy getting to know you, Bill. If we live long enough. FADE OUT. PART TEN FADE IN: 212 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND MYSTERY VESSEL (OPTICAL) In orbit over the planet. 213 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM Riker\\'s away team moving onto the transporter platform. With him are Data, Troi, and Tasha. They carry the usual away team equipment which they\\'re now checking. RIKER Phasers on stun. Everyone checks hand phasers. AD-LIB answers of \"checked\", \"on stun,\" etc. Riker turns to Transporter Chief. RIKER Energize. 214 INT. MYSTERY SHIP TUNNEL - WIDE ANGLE (OPTICAL) TRANSPORTER SOUND, then the BEAMING EFFECT. Then, fully MATERIALIZED, Riker and the others look around to orient themselves. DATA Most interesting, sir. TASHA Much the same construction as the underground tunnel we saw. Which describes it perfectly. The same rounded shape and GLOWING WALL of unknown composition. The \"tunnel\" is deserted; NO SHIP SOUNDS of any kind. TASHA (continuing) But no sound of power; no equipment. How does this ship run? Riker nods a direction. Tasha takes the point as they move out. Clearly, these are exceptionally well trained people. Data is already using his tricorder to check the walls. He obviously gets nothing, shakes his head. Troi suddenly staggers, GROANS. 214 CONTINUED: RIKER Troi, what is it?! (waits anxiously) Is it the same as you felt down there? TROI No, this is... different. It feels much more powerful... full of anger... hate... TASHA Toward us? TROI No. It\\'s directed down toward the old Bandi city. DATA Most intriguing again. The place that this vessel was firing upon... (abruptly stops; to Riker) Sorry, sir, I seem to be commenting on everything. RIKER (small smile) Good. Don\\'t stop it, my friend. 215 EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL) Enterprise and the mystery vessel still in orbit. 216 INT. BRIDGE - EMPHASIZING PICARD Geordi and Worf at their positions. Picard is in the command seat, antsy. RIKER\\'S VOICE Enterprise, Riker. This is turning out to be a very long tunnel or corridor, sir. Still no sign of mechanism or circuitry... 217 INT. NARROW MYSTERY SHIP TUNNEL - RIKER AND GROUP Still led and followed by the security people, they\\'re now moving along fairly rapidly although this tunnel is narrower here. Otherwise, its look hasn\\'t changed. RIKER (continuing) ... or controls, readouts, nothing at all like any vessel I\\'ve seen before. TROI (interrupting) Groppler Zorn, sir... in great fear... (motions) Just ahead. 218 INT. TUNNEL CONNECTION Troi and the team arriving, standing puzzled at what seems to be only a sharp turn where we SEE a strange indentation in the tunnel wall there. Troi, intent on this, steps closer, pushes her body against the indentation. TROI It\\'s definitely Zorn, Commander. Here! RIKER (stepping in) Careful... But the tunnel wall is soft here -- it gives perceptibly, as Troi pushes harder and then PLOP... she disappears through it. (NOTE: Or the \\'wall\\' opens to let her through and then closes behind her.) RIKER Troi!!! Then he pushes, disappears through the same wall. 219 INT. ZORN\\'S \"CELL\" Riker sliding through the pliable opening in the tunnel wall, joining Troi who is standing there aghast at what is suspended in the center of this area. 220 ANGLE AT FORCE FIELD (OPTICAL) Zorn is held suspended off the deck in the center of a cylindrical forcefield. The force field edges GLITTER SOFTLY to outline the shape of it. 221 ANGLE ON THE AWAY TEAM (OPTICAL) As the other team members come through the \\'wall\\' too, stand, reacting at the sight of Zorn. 222 ANGLE AT FORCE FIELD (OPTICAL) The FORCEFIELD SPARKLES, CLICKS, causing Zorn to writhe and twitch. He SCREAMS. ZORN No! Please! No more! Please, no more... 223 ANGLE ON AWAY TEAM (OPTICAL) They move forward toward him, and are brought up sharply by the leading edge of the force field. Data has already started to scan with his tricorder. Riker calls to Zorn. RIKER (continuing) Zorn. Can you hear me? Zorn manages to lift his head, and WE SEE his pain-filled face, his features twisted into a grimace of intense agony. ZORN Make it stop the pain. Please... TROI Has the alien communicated... ? (breaks off; then to Riker) That\\'s it, sir! It\\'s just one alien that I\\'m sensing here. ZORN (another GROAN) Please! I don\\'t understand what it wants. TROI (studying Zorn; then) Not true. He does know. 223 CONTINUED: Data interrupts by holding his tricorder so that Riker can see the readings he\\'s gathered. Riker registers at seeing something unique as Data pulls out his phaser, Riker does the same and both of them concentrate on making some exact setting on their phasers. 224 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL) As Data and Riker raise their phasers toward Zorn. ZORN (in terror) No, no, please don\\'t! Data and Riker trigger their phasers and we SEE a SORT OF COLORED GLOW on the FORCEFIELD HOLDING Zorn, the GLOW SPREADING OVER THE ENTIRE FORCEFIELD. Then, suddenly the FORCEFIELD DISAPPEARS, GLOW AND ALL, and Zorn tumbles out onto the floor free of restraint. 225 EMPHASIZING \"LIVE\" PART OF CELL WALL (EFFECTS) Where the wall seems to be \"alive\", undulating. Beyond it, Tasha is assisting Zorn to his feet, supporting him. Meanwhile, Troi looks around Zorn\\'s \"cell\", sensing something troubling. Riker has turned on his communicator: RIKER Away team to Enterprise... A TENDRIL OF PLASMA EMERGES FROM THIS PART OF THE WALL, swaying and moving toward Troi. DATA (interrupting; warning) Troi... ! But the TENDRIL is already wrapping around her. Data tries to pull the TENDRIL from Troi, succeeds only in getting a NEW TENDRIL wrapped around himself. 226 ANOTHER ANGLE (EFFECTS) The floor of the area suddenly going soft, away team members sinking into it while still ANOTHER SECTION OF WALL FOLDS ITSELF OVER TASHA. (What we\\'re seeing is this part of the mystery \"vessel\" becoming a living thing.) 226 CONTINUED: RIKER Enterprise, come in. Beam us... Interrupted as his feet are YANKED OUT FROM UNDER HIM. DATA Enterprise, we need help... Interrupted by the NEW TENDRIL WRAPPING ITSELF AROUND HIS HEAD. 227 INT. BRIDGE Picard speaking anxiously toward his command panel as we HEAR Riker\\'s MUFFLED SOUNDS OF DISTRESS. PICARD Transporter chief, yank them back! Now! WORF Captain... ! 228 ANGLE INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL) Toward which Lieutenant Worf is pointing. On it the IMAGE of the mystery vessel is BEGINNING TO CHANGE IN SHAPE. The firm, hard edges of the spaceship are giving way to something softer, very mysterious in nature. 229 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL) In which we SEE a familiar BLINDING FLASH and \"Q\" appears, now wearing the uniform of a STARFLEET CAPTAIN. \"Q\" (STARFLEET) Your time is up, Captain. PICARD Get off my bridge! (into command panel) Transporter Chief, do you have their coordinates? 230 ANOTHER ANGLE (EFFECTS) \"Q\" stepping to the command position. \"Q\" (STARFLEET) He can\\'t hear you, Captain. 230 CONTINUED: \"Q\" gestures upward, at which Picard is suddenly lifted into the air and then to the side of \"Q\"\\'s hand motion in that direction. PICARD \"Q\", I\\'ve people in trouble over there... ! As Picard hovers above, \"Q\" steps up and sits in Picard\\'s command position. Bridge personnel are coming to their feet angrily, then hesitate as: PICARD (continuing) Everyone, at ease! That\\'s an order! (to \"Q\") My people are in trouble, \"Q\". Help them; I\\'ll do whatever you say... As \"Q\" gives another hand signal downward, the Captain is gently deposited onto the deck. 231 WIDE PORTION OF BRIDGE (OPTICAL) As the same strange transporter SOUND that accompanied Zorn\\'s \"kidnapping\" is heard and the same STRANGE TRANSPORTER EFFECT APPEARS, this time MATERIALIZING FIVE IMAGES -- Riker, Data, Troi, Tasha, and Groppler Zorn. 232 ANGLE EMPHASIZING PICARD Very surprised, looking from his away team to \"Q\". \"Q\" (STARFLEET) You\\'ll do whatever I say? PICARD (hesitates; nods) It seems I did make that bargain. TROI The agreement isn\\'t valid, sir. It wasn\\'t \"Q\" that saved us. \"Q\" (STARFLEET) (quickly; indicating viewer) Save yourselves! It may attack you now. 233 ANGLE INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL) On which the changed IMAGE of the mystery \"vessel\" seems to be floating in closer to the Enterprise. RIKER It was that which sent us back, Captain. TROI Yes sir. It\\'s not a vessel, sir. It\\'s alive somehow... \"Q\" (STARFLEET) She lies! Destroy it while you have a chance. (to Tasha) Make phasers and photon torpedoes ready... ! PICARD No! Do nothing he suggests! ZORN But that thing was killing my people, Captain... PICARD True, but why? Was there a reason? \"Q\" (STARFLEET) It is an unknown, Captain! Isn\\'t that enough? PICARD If you had earned that uniform you\\'re wearing, you\\'d know that the unknown is what brings us out here! \"Q\" (STARFLEET) Wasted effort, considering the human intelligence. PICARD Let\\'s test that... (to Zorn) ... starting with the tunnels you have under Farpoint, Groppler. RIKER Identical to the ones on that space vessel lifeform, over there. Why was it punishing you, Groppler? 233 CONTINUED: PICARD In return for pain you caused to some other creature? ZORN We did nothing wrong! It was injured, we helped it... PICARD (interrupting; to Zorn) Thank you, that was the missing part. (turns) Tasha, rig phasers to deliver an energy beam. TASHA (puzzled) Aye, sir. Tasha steps to her panel, makes settings on controls there. RIKER Yes, Captain, I understand now. It has to be conceivable that somewhere in the galaxy there could exist creatures able to convert energy into matter... PICARD (nodding) And into specific patterns of matter. Much as our transporters do. TASHA (indicating) On the viewer, Captain! 234 ANGLE EMPHASIZING MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL) Where the vessel/creature IMAGE is SOFTENING FURTHER INTO AN AMORPHOUS, COLORFUL AND LOVELY SHAPE. Picard turns to the Groppler, demanding: PICARD Zorn, you captured something like that, didn\\'t you? On main viewer, the IMAGE NOW SHOWS LOVELY FEATHERY TENDRILS, and it is BEGINNING TO MOVE DOWN TOWARD THE PLANET. Zorn reacts to this, shows panic. 234 CONTINUED: ZORN Warn my people, please! Leave Farpoint Station immediately! \"Q\" (STARFLEET) He\\'s lied to you, Captain. Shouldn\\'t you let his people die? PICARD (nods to Ops) Transmit the message. \"Leave Farpoint immediately\". TROI Then it was a pair of creatures I was sensing. One down there in grief and pain, the other up here, filled with anger... DATA (nodding) And firing not on the new space station, but on the old Bandi city. PICARD (to \"Q\") Attacking those who captured it\\'s... (to Troi) ... it\\'s mate? TASHA Energy beam ready, sir. PICARD (to Tasha) Lock it in on Farpoint Station. \"Q\" stands in an annoyed manner, indicates the captain\\'s position to Picard. \"Q\" (STARFLEET) I see now it was too simple a puzzle. But generosity has always been my weakness. As \"Q\" moves aside, Picard takes his position, turning to Tasha. PICARD Let it have whatever it can absorb. Energize! 235 EXT SPACE - THE ENTERRPISE (OPTICAL) in orbit, as a THICK, PALE BLUE ENERGY BEAM AIMS DOWNWARD. 236 EXT. FARPOINT STATION (OPTICAL) HIGH DOWNWARD SHOT SHOWING THE ENERGY BEAM terminating and being absorbed into Farpoint Station. 237 INT. BRIDGE - INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL) Picard and others watching the energy beam terminating at Farpoint Station. TASHA Now getting feedback on the beam, sir. PICARD Discontinue it. (to Zorn) Groppler Zorn, there\\'ll soon be no Farpoint Station if I\\'m right about this. \"Q\" (STARFLEET) A lucky guess! ZORN I know we deserve this loss, but please believe me, we meant not to harm the creature, but to use it. TROI Sir, a feeling of great joy. And gratitude. 238 EXT. FARPOINT STATION (OPTICAL) The city/station miniature -- the Farpoint Station part of it GROWING SOFT, SHIMMERING, SLOWLY BECOMES A CREATURE OF GOSSAMER, FEATHERY LIGHTNESS -- now gracefully rising up from its captivity. 239 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL) Where what was once the \"mystery vessel\" but now an increasingly beautiful COLORFUL, FEATHERY TENDRIL SHAPE is descending closer and closer to what was once the Farpoint Station part of city/station (miniature). 239 CONTINUED: THE TWO CREATURES (OPTICAL) The smaller one rising up toward its mate. They touch -- delicate matter/energy tendrils twining -- and then together they move upwards out of sight. 240 EXT SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL) As the two creatures rise up past it. 241 INT. BRIDGE - INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL) On which the two creatures are rising upward OUT OF IMAGE FRAME. TROI Great joy and gratitude... from both of them. 242 ANGLE EMPHASIZING \"Q\" (OPTICAL) As Picard turns on him. PICARD And why? Because it furnishes entertainment to you! You use other lifeforms for recreation. \"Q\" (STARFLEET) If so, you\\'ve not provided the best... PICARD Get off my ship, you smug hypocrite. \"Q\" (STARFLEET) Why not? We can also meet another time, another place. PICARD That\\'s doesn\\'t frighten us at all! You accuse us of \"grievous savagery\"? No, the one proven guilty of that crime is you! 242 CONTINUED: ANOTHER BLINDING FLASH AND \"Q\" DISAPPEARS. It takes a moment to realize that he is gone. Then: RIKER I trust this isn\\'t the usual way our missions will go, sir. Picard screws up his face in mock consideration of this, then nods. PICARD On no, Number One, I\\'m sure they\\'ll be much more interesting. FADE OUT. THE END'"

STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE \"What You Leave Behind\" TEASER FADE IN: 1 INT. BASHIR\\'S QUARTERS - BEDROOM CLOSE ON DOCTOR BASHIR, sleeping. COMPUTER VOICE Doctor Bashir. The time is oh- five hundred. Bashir forces his eyes open. BASHIR Right. After a beat, Bashir closes his eyes again. Suddenly -- 2 A WOMAN\\'S HAND reaches over from the other side of the bed and shakes him softly. EZRI\\'S VOICE Julian... we have to get up. 3 BASHIR turns over to his other side as we ADJUST to REVEAL EZRI DAX, lying next to him. They snuggle for a beat. BASHIR Are you sure? EZRI It\\'s a big day. BASHIR It was a big night. (a beat) It cleared up a lot of questions. EZRI Such as? DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - TEASER 2. 3 CONTINUED: BASHIR (touching one of Ezri\\'s Trill markings) How far those spots go down. EZRI (smiling) I suppose you\\'re going to want to tell Miles. BASHIR Why would I do that? EZRI Because you tell him everything. BASHIR (thinking it over) True... but this time, I\\'ll make an exception. EZRI Good -- now we really should get going. We don\\'t want the Defiant leaving without us. But Bashir makes no move to get out of bed. BASHIR You know, I\\'ve never gone into battle with someone I\\'ve slept with. EZRI There\\'s a first time for everything. BASHIR Now that we\\'re finally together, it\\'d be a shame if anything happened to one of us... Ezri offers Bashir her hand to shake. EZRI Let\\'s make a pact. We both come home alive. Bashir takes her hand. BASHIR You\\'ve got yourself a deal. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - TEASER 2A. 3 CONTINUED: (2) EZRI I\\'m going to hold you to that. They lean over and kiss. After a moment, they both slip out of bed on opposite sides. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - TEASER 3. 4 INT. O\\'BRIENS\\' QUARTERS O\\'BRIEN, in his Starfleet uniform, steps out of his bedroom pretending not to have a care in the world. KEIKO is feeding KIRAYOSHI, while MOLLY is finishing her breakfast. O\\'BRIEN (to Keiko) Now remember, Kirayoshi has his checkup tomorrow morning at oh- nine hundred. KEIKO (nodding) I\\'ve already confirmed the appointment with Nurse Bandee. (to Kirayoshi) One more bite... O\\'BRIEN And try to get some rest... don\\'t stay up too late writing that paper on... whatever those trees are called. KEIKO Arfillian Ficus and they\\'re not trees, they\\'re shrubs. O\\'BRIEN Right. Anyway, be sure to get some sleep, oh yeah, and -- KEIKO (gently) Miles -- stop worrying. We\\'re going to be fine. O\\'BRIEN I know. O\\'Brien leans over and kisses her. Just then something off-screen catches his eye -- DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - TEASER 3A. 4 CONTINUED: O\\'BRIEN Molly -- don\\'t touch that! 5 ANGLE ON MOLLY leaning over the Alamo model, playing with some of the miniature soldiers. The model -- as we all know -- is enormous and takes up a large portion of the room. MOLLY I let you play with my toys. O\\'BRIEN It\\'s not a toy -- it\\'s a model. KEIKO (teasing) Then maybe it belongs in a museum. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - TEASER 4. 5 CONTINUED: O\\'BRIEN I suppose I could give it to Julian... KEIKO Sounds good to me. Speaking of Julian... have you told him about Starfleet\\'s offer yet? O\\'BRIEN I haven\\'t had time. MOLLY I knew it. O\\'BRIEN What\\'s that supposed to mean? MOLLY We\\'re not going back to Earth. O\\'BRIEN Of course we are. Daddy\\'s going to teach at the Academy -- as soon as the war\\'s over. MOLLY Then why haven\\'t you told Julian? KEIKO (smiling) Out of the mouth of babes... DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - TEASER 5. 5 CONTINUED: (2) O\\'BRIEN I\\'ll tell him. (a beat) When I think he\\'s ready to hear it. (to Kirayoshi) I love you. Be a good boy, now. (to Molly) And you listen to Mommy while I\\'m gone. MOLLY I always listen to Mommy. He kisses Molly and Kirayoshi, then hugs and kisses Keiko. KEIKO Just you be careful. O\\'BRIEN I always am. They hold each other extra tight. 6 INT. SISKO\\'S QUARTERS KASIDY is lying on the couch, GROANING softly, as CAPTAIN SISKO places a cold compress on her forehead. SISKO How\\'s that? KASIDY It\\'s doing wonders for my head. But it\\'s my stomach that\\'s bothering me... DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - TEASER 6. 6 CONTINUED: SISKO Well, if it helps -- morning sickness usually ends after the first trimester. KASIDY That\\'s two more months! I don\\'t think I\\'m going to make it. SISKO You\\'ll make it. Kasidy lays her head against Sisko\\'s chest. KASIDY Promise me something, Ben... (patting her stomach) ... promise you\\'ll come back to us. SISKO I promise. Kasidy pulls away from Sisko with sudden distress. KASIDY I don\\'t believe it... SISKO (defensive) I said I promise. KASIDY (hit by another wave of nausea) It\\'s not that... Kasidy bolts to her feet and makes a beeline for the bathroom. Just then, the door CHIMES. SISKO Come in. The door OPENS to REVEAL -- 7 JAKE SISKO yawning and wiping the sleep from his eyes. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - TEASER 7 7 CONTINUED: JAKE I thought I\\'d walk you to the Defiant. SISKO I\\'d like that. JAKE (looking around the room) How\\'s Kas? A LOUD GROAN is heard off-screen. SISKO That answer your question? Kasidy reenters the room, looking the worse for wear. KASIDY Reports of my death have been exaggerated. (a beat) But not by much. Kasidy lies back down on the couch. JAKE Isn\\'t there something you can take to make you feel better? SISKO She doesn\\'t believe in taking medication unless it\\'s absolutely necessary. She GROANS again. JAKE Sounds necessary to me. KASIDY (to Sisko) Waiting for you to leave only makes me feel worse. If you\\'re going to go -- go. SISKO You\\'re sure I can\\'t get you anything? In response, Kasidy gets to her feet and again bolts for the bathroom. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - TEASER 8. 7 CONTINUED: (2) SISKO I think she\\'s sure... JAKE Times like this... I\\'m glad I\\'m a man. And with that, they EXIT into the corridor -- 8 INT. QUARK\\'S CLOSE ON QUARK as he places a drink in front of WORF. It\\'s still very early and MORN is the only other customer. QUARK You\\'re up early today. WORF I\\'m always up early. QUARK But this is a special day, isn\\'t it? WORF I don\\'t know what you mean. QUARK (leaning over, confidentially) It\\'s a good day to die. WORF Every day is a good day to die. QUARK But some days are better than others. Like today, for instance. The day the Federation- Klingon-Romulan Alliance launches its invasion of Cardassia. The final push in the long struggle to rid the Alpha Quadrant of the Dominion and save my bar in the process. WORF (calmly) Who told you that? QUARK (re: Morn) He did. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - TEASER 9. 8 CONTINUED: Worf looks over to Morn who stares back at him blankly. WORF Morn? And how does he know? QUARK (joking) He\\'s friends with Admiral Ross. Or maybe Sisko told him while they were having dinner. I don\\'t know how he knows. He just knows. Worf takes a final sip of his drink giving away nothing. WORF I have to go. Worf gets up from his stool and EXITS. We hold on a triumphant Quark watching him leave. QUARK Good guess, Morn. Today\\'s the day... 9 INT. PROMENADE Worf heads for the airlock when ODO joins him. ODO Mind if I walk with you, commander? WORF Not at all. Captain Sisko informed me you were joining us on the mission. (a beat) I hope that when we reach Cardassia, we find Colonel Kira alive and well. ODO So do I, commander. So do I... Sharing that sentiment, they EXIT into the turbolift. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - TEASER 10. 10 OMITTED 11 INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE Worf, O\\'Brien, Bashir, Odo and Ezri are at their stations with NOG at helm as Sisko steps onto the Bridge. NOG Captain on the bridge. All eyes are on Sisko as he stands in front of the Captain\\'s Chair. He looks around the room at the expectant faces of his crew. After a beat: SISKO All right, people... what do you say we end this war? O\\'BRIEN Sounds good to me. SISKO (to Nog) Ensign, I believe you know the way to Cardassia. NOG If I get lost, I\\'ll just follow the ship in front of us. 12 EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL) as the Defiant joins a huge fleet of Federation, Klingon and Romulan ships headed for Cardassian space. And on that image, we: FADE OUT. END OF TEASER DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT ONE 11. ACT ONE FADE IN: (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) 13 EXT. CARDASSIA PRIME - SUNSET Establishing. 14 INT. DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM - SUNSET CLOSE ON a monitor depicting the Federation fleet approaching Cardassian Territory. 15 TIGHT ON WEYOUN as he studies the monitor, its display lights playing across his face. Weyoun has his game face on, staring at the invasion fleet icons with a cold, implacable hatred. WEYOUN The Federation invasion fleet has left Deep Space Nine. They\\'ll reach the Cardassian border by tomorrow night. ADJUST to REVEAL the FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER, seated at a desk. The changeling disease has her looking as dry and desiccated as we\\'ve ever seen. And though her illness has clearly left her physically weakened, her intelligence and intensity remain unaffected. The Breen General, THOT PRAN, stands nearby. FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER (to Thot Pran) Our brave Jem\\'Hadar soldiers have a motto \"Victory is Life.\" The Breen answers with STATIC. FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER I\\'m glad you\\'re familiar with it. Because today, those words have meaning for us all. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT ONE 12. 15 CONTINUED: FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER (Cont\\'d) The outcome of this battle will determine the outcome of the war. Either we destroy their invasion force or they destroy us. There are no other options. More Breen STATIC. FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER Fight well today, and Romulus will be yours to do with as you please. More Breen STATIC. FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER Yes, yes -- and Earth too. The Breen again offers STATIC. FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER I assure you, the pleasure is all mine. With a final BURST of STATIC, the Breen steps over to a monitor and begins working the console, ordering his troops into position. 16 WEYOUN can\\'t help but feeling a little jealous at the generosity the Female Shape-shifter has shown the Breen. The Female Shape-shifter notices Weyoun\\'s hurt pride. FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER Is something bothering you? WEYOUN Apparently, I was under the mistaken impression that all Federation territories would fall under my jurisdiction -- including Earth. FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER And so they shall. WEYOUN But you just promised the Breen... DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT ONE 13. 16 CONTINUED: FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER I\\'d promise the Breen the entire Alpha Quadrant if I thought it would help win this war. The two stare at each other for a moment, then Weyoun bows his head. WEYOUN The Founder is wise in all things. 16A NEW ANGLE as the newly appointed leader of the Cardassian Union, LEGATE BROCA, ENTERS. He bows reverentially to the Female Shape-shifter. BROCA Founder. I\\'ve heard a disturbing rumor about the traitor Damar. WEYOUN What about him? BROCA He may be alive. FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER (to Weyoun) Is this possible? WEYOUN I don\\'t see how. We destroyed his ship, his rebel bases... FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER But his body was never found. BROCA They say he\\'s here -- on Cardassia Prime. In the capital, no less... FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER (to Broca) Look into this matter. WEYOUN And if Damar is alive... DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT ONE 13A. 16A CONTINUED: BROCA ... he won\\'t be for long. Weyoun smiles; he can think of nothing that would give him greater pleasure than the sight of Damar lying dead at his feet. 17 EXT. CARDASSIAN ALLEY - NIGHT Seemingly deserted except for TWO JEM\\'HADAR soldiers on patrol. Once they pass out of frame, GARAK and DAMAR come out of the shadows and stealthily make their way in the opposite direction. 18 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL) as they move down the alleyway, hugging the walls. Suddenly, a bright beam of light floods the area around them followed immediately by a PHASER BOLT slamming into the wall by their heads. JEM\\'HADAR VOICE Halt. Squinting in the light, they see -- DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT ONE 14. 19 TWO JEM\\'HADAR SOLDIERS standing further down the alley, blocking their path. One of them holds a Jem\\'Hadar palm beacon on them at all times. JEM\\'HADAR Step forward. Slowly. Garak and Damar exchange a worried look, but they both realize they have little choice but to do as instructed. GARAK (to the Jem\\'Hadar) Have we done something wrong? We\\'re new to the city and I\\'m afraid we\\'ve gotten lost -- JEM\\'HADAR Quiet! The Jem\\'Hadar steps up to get a closer look at the two Cardassians. JEM\\'HADAR You are Legate Damar. GARAK (to Damar) You see? I told you you looked like him. (to the Jem\\'Hadar) This isn\\'t the first time my cousin has been mistaken for that traitor. JEM\\'HADAR (unswayed) He will be taken to Dominion Headquarters. You will die here. The Jem\\'Hadar soldier points his weapon directly at Garak. Just then, we hear a burst of odd-sounding BREEN STATIC (actually, it sounds like someone mimicking Breen static). The Jem\\'Hadar shines his beacon on a -- 20 BREEN SOLDIER standing at the other end of the alley. The Breen soldier approaches and repeats the muffled STATIC. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT ONE 15. 20 CONTINUED: JEM\\'HADAR (to the Breen) I do not understand you. The Breen soldier, now only few feet away, lifts up his weapon and FIRES -- 21 HITTING THE TWO JEM\\'HADAR (OPTICAL) who fall dead. 22 GARAK AND DAMAR look on with surprise. Help from a Breen was the last thing they expected. 23 THE BREEN SOLDIER steps up to the bodies of the two Jem\\'Hadar and takes off (his) helmet, REVEALING KIRA. GARAK I hope you don\\'t consider me ungrateful, but what are you doing here? KIRA Watching your backs. DAMAR I thought we agreed it would be safer if you stayed out of sight. KIRA That\\'s what the helmet\\'s for. You should be wearing one, too. Every Jem\\'Hadar and Breen soldier on Cardassia is looking for you. DAMAR If I\\'m going to lead this revolt, I can\\'t do it hiding in a cellar. I had to attend tonight\\'s gathering. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT ONE 16. 23 CONTINUED: GARAK (to Kira) It was a great success. KIRA You can tell me the details later. Kira puts back the helmet. KIRA (muffled) If anyone asks, you\\'re my prisoners. And with that, she marches them down the alley -- 24 INT. CARDASSIAN CELLAR - NIGHT CLOSE ON a pair of feet coming down the stairs. It\\'s MILA, carrying a tray of food, which she sets on the table near Kira, Garak and Damar. The Breen outfit lies discarded behind Kira. GARAK (to Kira) ... the vote was unanimous. The work disruptions will begin tomorrow. DAMAR (also to Kira) Power, transportation and communication facilities throughout Cardassia will be sabotaged. GARAK The Dominion fleet will be cut off from all ground support. KIRA (she gets it) That way, they\\'ll have to face the invasion force on their own. DAMAR And once the Dominion is crushed... MILA (O.S.) Cardassia will be free again. All eyes turn to Mila. DEEP SPACE NINE:\\'What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT ONE 17. 24 CONTINUED: MILA (to Garak) When you were a small boy, I was worried about you. Always getting in trouble. Secretive... so full of deceit. Little did I know you would turn such distasteful characteristics into virtues. (a beat) More tea? GARAK You\\'re too kind. And as Mila pours him some tea -- 25 EXT. SPACE - DEFIANT (OPTICAL)(STOCK) moving with the Federation/Klingon/Romulan fleet. 26 INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE As before. Sisko is standing between the Captain\\'s Chair and helm, listening intently to a sound we can\\'t hear. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT ONE 18. 26 CONTINUED: SISKO You hear that, Chief? O\\'BRIEN (nodding) Sounds like the Doppler compensators are out of phase. O\\'Brien begins working his panel. SISKO (to Nog) How\\'s she handling, ensign? NOG She\\'s not quite as smooth as the old Defiant, sir. Feels a bit sluggish. SISKO Chief? O\\'BRIEN I\\'m on it. (to the com) O\\'Brien to Engineering. Recalibrate the inertial dampers and check the plasma flow regulators while you\\'re at it. ENGINEERING COM VOICE Right away, Chief. O\\'Brien, who has yet to tell Bashir about his plans to return to Earth, isn\\'t in the best of moods. He continues to work his panel. O\\'BRIEN (muttering) You\\'d think someone would\\'ve come up with a a better inertial control system... BASHIR What\\'s that, Miles? O\\'BRIEN I said, could you please wipe that grin off your face? You\\'re not the first person to fall in love, you know. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT ONE 19. 26 CONTINUED: (2) BASHIR I thought you\\'d be happy for me. O\\'BRIEN (gruffly) I am happy for you. (to com) O\\'Brien to Engineering. Now try re-aligning the induction coils. ENGINEERING COM VOICE Will do. O\\'BRIEN (to Bashir) Look, Julian... there\\'s something I have to talk to you about. BASHIR You\\'re getting pressure from Keiko, aren\\'t you? O\\'BRIEN (surprised) How\\'d you know? BASHIR It\\'s a big decision. I\\'m surprised it didn\\'t come up sooner. O\\'BRIEN Actually, we\\'ve been talking about it for quite a while. BASHIR Well, you can stop talking about it. (magnanimous) We\\'ll put the Alamo in my quarters. NOG (re: the helm) I could still use a little more equalization on the torque buffers. O\\'BRIEN Right. I\\'ll try to compensate with the impulse response filters. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT ONE 19A. 26 CONTINUED: (3) BASHIR (to O\\'Brien, re: the model) That way, your quarters won\\'t be so cluttered and you can still use it whenever you want. O\\'BRIEN I wasn\\'t talking about the Alamo model. Besides, it\\'s too big for your quarters. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT ONE 20. 26 CONTINUED: (4) BASHIR You let me worry about that. So what did you want to talk to me about? O\\'Brien just can\\'t bring himself to tell Julian the news about his leaving. O\\'BRIEN It\\'s nothing that can\\'t wait. (working his panel) Is that any better, Nog? NOG (nodding) Torque buffers are stable. 27 ANGLE ON EZRI AND WORF as they work their consoles, side by side. EZRI You\\'re sure you\\'re not angry? WORF Why should I be angry? I\\'ve been asking you to tell the doctor how you feel about him for the past month. EZRI Well, now that he knows how I feel... WORF I am happy for you. EZRI That\\'s a relief. WORF (dry) ... but I am going to kill him. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT ONE 21. 27 CONTINUED: Ezri shoots him a look -- EZRI You\\'re kidding, right? WORF And Jadzia said I had no sense of humor. 28 ANGLE ON A PENSIVE ODO as Sisko approaches him. SISKO I wish she were here, too, Constable. ODO If I only knew where Kira was... that she was all right... SISKO The colonel\\'s a survivor. She knows how to take care of herself. Odo tries to find comfort in his words, but it isn\\'t easy. ODO This war, captain... it has to end. SISKO One way or another... it will. And soon. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT ONE 22. 29 CLOSER ON SISKO (OPTICAL) as he leans back in his chair and we push in tight on his face. Suddenly, a BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT FILLS THE SCREEN -- 30 INT. PROMENADE - VISION (OPTICAL) We hear the characteristic HEARTBEAT sound as Sisko finds himself standing before SARAH PROPHET in front of the Bajoran Shrine. SISKO Mother? SARAH PROPHET The Emissary\\'s task is nearing completion. SISKO Are you talking about the war? SARAH PROPHET You have walked the path the Prophets laid out for you, Benjamin. Do not falter now. SISKO I don\\'t intend to. Sarah Prophet steps closer to Sisko and caresses his cheek. SARAH PROPHET Know this, my son. Your journey\\'s end lies not before you, but behind you. And as she lowers her hand, the SCREEN WHITES OUT and we -- CUT TO: 31 INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE CLOSE ON Sisko as he comes out of his vision. ODO Captain? DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT ONE 23. 31 CONTINUED: SISKO (pensive) The Prophets just came to me in a vision... ODO I take it they weren\\'t bringing good news. SISKO I\\'m not sure. I suppose only time will tell. And off this moment -- 32 EXT. BAJOR - DAY (STOCK) Establishing. 33 INT. KAI WINN\\'S OFFICE - DAY KAI WINN is sitting alone in her office reading the text of the Kosst Amojan. We hear the door OPEN. DUKAT (O.S.) Hello, Adami. The Kai doesn\\'t look up, she merely turns another page in the book. WINN You\\'re back. ADJUST to REVEAL DUKAT, still a Bajoran, but no longer blind. His clothes are dusty and ragged. DUKAT Is that all you have to say to me? The Kai looks up for the first time, giving Dukat a quick once over. WINN I see the Pah-wraiths have restored your sight. Determined to get back in her good graces, Dukat hides his anger behind a humble smile. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT ONE 23A. 33 CONTINUED: DUKAT They\\'ve forgiven me. I hope you can find it in your heart to do the same. Winn leans back in her chair. WINN I don\\'t forgive war criminals. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT ONE 24. 33 CONTINUED: (2) WINN (Cont\\'d) To think I took Gul Dukat to my bed, one of the most hated men in Bajoran history... DUKAT Adami -- I\\'ve told you how much I regret my actions during the occupation... WINN (scornful) Of course you do. Dukat looks over at the text the Kai\\'s been studying. DUKAT (glad to change the subject) Have you learned how to release the Pah-wraiths? WINN (nodding) The secrets of the Kosst Amojan have been revealed to me. DUKAT Then why haven\\'t you gone to the Fire Caves and freed them? WINN (with a beguiling smile) I was waiting for you. This is exactly what Dukat was hoping to hear. DUKAT So you do forgive me... She gets up from behind the desk and crosses over to him. WINN I need your help, Dukat. It\\'s as simple as that. DUKAT All you have to do is ask. Dukat takes Kai Winn\\'s hand, cupping it in his. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT ONE 25. 33 CONTINUED: (3) DUKAT Together we\\'ll free the Pah- wraiths so they can lay claim to the Celestial Temple and destroy the Prophets. WINN And their Emissary... DUKAT No -- Benjamin Sisko will be dealt with by me and me alone. WINN Assuming he survives the invasion of Cardassia. DUKAT He\\'ll survive... but I promise you, he\\'ll wish he hadn\\'t. And as Dukat and Winn savor their approaching victory, we: FADE OUT.

HOLOSUITE - VIC\\'S LOUNGE Quark intently studies a hand of playing cards he\\'s holding close to his face. QUARK Do you have any threes? ADJUST to include VIC FONTAINE seated across from Quark, studying his own hand. VIC Go fish. Quark sighs with disappointment and throws the cards down. VIC Don\\'t tell me you\\'re quitting? QUARK It\\'s just not my game. VIC Want to try pinochle again? Quark shakes his head. VIC How \\'bout rummy? Or gin rummy? Five card stud? (a beat) Canasta? But Quark doesn\\'t want to play any of them. QUARK How about some tongo? VIC (rhetorically) Did they play tongo in Las Vegas in nineteen sixty-two? DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT TWO 27. 35 CONTINUED: QUARK How could they? It\\'s a Ferengi game. VIC Which is why my holographic program can\\'t create it. QUARK I know, I know this place is period specific. For a hologram, you\\'re not very accommodating. VIC Is that why you dropped by? To insult me? QUARK I dropped by because I had nothing else to do. My bar hasn\\'t had half a dozen customers all day. Everyone\\'s off fighting this stupid war. But Vic knows what\\'s really bothering him. VIC It\\'s not easy to stay behind, is it? Knowing that your friends are out there risking their lives... But Quark refuses to admit it. QUARK They think they have it rough, they should try living my life for a day. The hospitality industry isn\\'t for the faint- hearted. VIC The bartender\\'s life is a lonely one. QUARK That\\'s right. But few people understand that. They think it\\'s one big, happy party. They forget that the person giving the party never has any fun. DEEP SPACE NINE:\\'What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT TWO 28. 35 CONTINUED: (2) QUARK (Cont\\'d) He\\'s too busy making sure everybody else is having fun. (a beat) All I do -- all day long -- is give, give, give... VIC Bartending is a very noble profession. And you do it well under some very difficult circumstances, I might add. You should be proud. QUARK You think so? VIC I know so, pallie. But Quark is still bothered by a deeper issue. QUARK I just hope Nog and the rest of those heroic idiots come back in one piece.. Just then, GINGER -- the girl last seen as Vic\\'s date in \"His Way\" -- approaches, dressed for a night on the town. GINGER Vic, sweetie, are you ready? Jimmy and Pete are about to go on. VIC (explaining to Quark) Sorry, pallie, gotta run. Durante and Lawford are at the Sands. Can\\'t miss that. Vic gets up and walks over to Ginger, who slips her arm through his. QUARK I thought you said a bartender\\'s life was a lonely one? VIC (what can I say?) It is. But I\\'m not a bartender. And with that, Vic and Ginger EXIT. We hold on Quark for a beat as he sighs with resignation. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT TWO 28A. 35 CONTINUED: (3) QUARK (to himself) Go fish. 36 OMITTED DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT TWO 29. 37 INT. BAJORAN FIRE CAVES (SECOND LEVEL CAVES) The caves are hot and steamy, the walls dripping with moisture. Dukat and Winn ENTER. Dukat carries a backpack containing various ceremonial artifacts. He doesn\\'t seem bothered by the heat. In fact, he finds it invigorating. On the other hand, Kai Winn, who holds the text of the Kosst Amojan nestled in her arms, looks like she\\'s about to melt. After a few steps, she stops to catch her breath, leaning against a rock. DUKAT (impatient) Is it really necessary to rest so often? WINN I don\\'t need you to wait for me. Go on ahead... wander aimlessly through these caves for the rest of your miserable life. DUKAT I\\'m in no hurry. (looking around) During the Occupation, my people found the Bajorans\\' fear of these caves amusing. (a beat) Yet somehow, none of us ever found the time to visit them. And now, here I am... Ironic, isn\\'t it? WINN I don\\'t care. DUKAT (surprised by her bluntness) Excuse me? WINN I\\'m sure you have many \"interesting\" anecdotes about the Occupation, but I have no desire to hear them. DUKAT I meant no disrespect, Adami -- WINN And stop calling me Adami. That privilege is no longer yours. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT TWO 30. 37 CONTINUED: DUKAT (holding his temper) I see. Then how should I... WINN From now on, you will address me as \"eminence.\" Is that clear? DUKAT Perfectly... eminence. And with that, Kai Winn gets up and resumes their trek through the caverns. 38 EXT. CARDASSIA PRIME - DUSK (OPTICAL)(STOCK) Re-establishing. 39 INT. DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM - DUSK Thot Pran stands in front of the Female Shape-shifter, who remains seated at her desk. The Breen General is mid-STATIC. Weyoun stands by a monitor. FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER (to Thot Pran) I see your point. But for two millennia the Jem\\'Hadar have been the Dominion\\'s first line of defense. It would damage their morale to take a back seat to the Breen. The Breen erupts with more STATIC. Whatever he\\'s saying, he\\'s saying it emphatically. FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER Very well. In the spirit of our new alliance, I will inform the Jem\\'Hadar that the Breen forces will be positioned alongside them. The Breen answers, somewhat mollified. FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER I\\'m glad that pleases you. But Weyoun isn\\'t quite satisfied with the situation. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT TWO 30A. 39 CONTINUED: WEYOUN (half to himself) I think we have a problem. The Female Shape-shifter and Thot Pran turn their attention to Weyoun. Thot Pran lets out a BURST of STATIC. WEYOUN Our lines are spread too thin, especially here -- (pointing) -- at the center. The Female Shape-shifter slowly and painfully rises out of her chair and walks over to the monitor. FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER (to the Breen) Do you agree? Thot Pran looks at the monitor then answers with some Breen STATIC. FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER (to Weyoun) Notify the Jem\\'Hadar. Order them to reinforce the center of their lines... DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT TWO 31. 39 CONTINUED: (2) But before the Shape-shifter can complete her thought, there is a POWER OUTAGE that dims the lights and blanks out the monitor. FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER Now what? The Breen General shouts some STATIC. After a few moments, the lights and monitor come back to life as the emergency backup systems kick in. Just then, a concerned Legate Broca hurries in. BROCA Founder -- I\\'m relieved to see you\\'re all right. WEYOUN Long range communications are down. I can\\'t contact the Jem\\'Hadar. More BREEN STATIC from Thot Pran. WEYOUN (peevish) Of course I\\'ll keep trying. FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER (to Broca) What caused the power failure? BROCA I\\'m afraid it was sabotage. WEYOUN (off his monitor) Almost every Dominion installation on Cardassia Prime has suffered damage. FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER (a curse) Damar. BROCA We captured some of the terrorists... (nervous) But they\\'re not soldiers -- they\\'re ordinary citizens. The Female Shape-shifter grabs Broca by the throat. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT TWO 32. 39 CONTINUED: (3) FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER Are you telling me the Cardassian people are rising up against us? BROCA (struggling to get the words out) I\\'m sure it\\'s only a small number of malcontents... FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER We have no way of knowing that, do we? WEYOUN Founder, may I make a suggestion? FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER (still strangling Broca) I\\'m sure Broca is most interested in what you have to say. WEYOUN If the Cardassian people are responsible for these acts of terrorism... if Damar and his fanatics have turned them against us, then it\\'s the people who should be punished. FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER (to Broca) What do you say to that? BROCA (barely croaking out the words) Severely punished. With that, the Female Shape-shifter finally releases Broca from her grip. FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER I\\'m glad we\\'re all in agreement. And with that, we: FADE OUT. END OF ACT TWO DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT THREE 33. ACT THREE FADE IN: 40 OMITTED 41 EXT. CARDASSIA PRIME - DUSK Re-establishing. 42 INT. CARDASSIAN CELLAR - DUSK The room is dark. All power has been cut off by the various acts of sabotage sweeping Cardassia. The only light source is a small, emergency lightstick. Kira, Damar and Garak are huddled over a Cardassian PADD. DAMAR (re: the PADD) It\\'s been twenty-four minutes. KIRA Not bad. GARAK If the Dominion hasn\\'t been able to restore power in the capital, then the entire planet must be in chaos... DAMAR Let\\'s hope so. Mila comes down the stairs, holding a couple of extra lightsticks. MILA I\\'m afraid I could only find two more lightsticks. I know there are others in the house somewhere... GARAK Stop dawdling and bring them over here. Mila does as instructed. MILA Ah, how well I remember that tone of voice... it reminds me of the demanding and inconsiderate boy ou used to be. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT THREE 34. 42 CONTINUED: GARAK I haven\\'t changed much, have I? DAMAR (off the PADD) This will send a clear message to the Dominion... the Cardassian people will fight to regain their freedom. KIRA I hope they realize their fight is just beginning. We have to hit the enemy again -- and harder this time. GARAK That won\\'t be easy. They\\'ll have tightened their security. KIRA It doesn\\'t matter -- we can\\'t lose our momentum. Damar smiles. DAMAR (to Garak) The colonel is right. We can\\'t rest until Cardassia is free. (a beat, to Kira) And when it is, we\\'ll have you to thank. Without you, this rebellion would\\'ve died in its infancy. GARAK (agreeing) How ironic that Cardassia\\'s saviour should be a former Bajoran terrorist. KIRA Don\\'t canonize me just yet. Suddenly, the lights come back on as the power is reinstated. DAMAR (off the PADD) Twenty-six and a half minutes. Let\\'s see what the Dominion has to say for itself. Garak moves over to the monitor and taps a few keys. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT THREE 34A. 43 ANGLE ON THE MONITOR (OPTICAL) coming to life with the image of Weyoun beginning a planetwide address. WEYOUN Citizens of Cardassia... shame on you. This latest wave of vandalism directed against your Dominion allies must stop. INTERCUT with Kira, Damar, Garak and Mila watching. GARAK I wouldn\\'t count on it. WEYOUN (on the monitor) Let me assure you, we know that these disgraceful acts of sabotage were carried out by a mere handful of extremists. But these radicals must come to realize that their disobedience will not be tolerated... that you, the Cardassian people, will suffer the consequences of their cowardly actions. Which is why I must inform you that a few moments ago, Dominion troops reduced Lakarian City to ashes. (a beat) There were no survivors. Two million men, women and children... gone in a matter of seconds.. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT THREE 35. 44 ANGLE ON KIRA AND THE OTHERS as they react to the grim news. 45 BACK ON WEYOUN (OPTICAL) continuing his address. WEYOUN (a beat) For each act of sabotage committed against the Dominion, another Cardassian city will be destroyed. (a beat) I implore you not to let that happen. Let us return to the spirit of friendship and cooperation that has existed between our peoples, so that together, we can defeat our common enemies... the Federation, the Klingons, the Romulans and all the others who stand against us. Thank you. And with that, Weyoun\\'s image is replaced by the Dominion logo. 46 ANGLE ON KIRA AND THE OTHERS as the impact of Weyoun\\'s words sink in. For a moment, the only sound we hear is Mila\\'s soft weeping. DAMAR I should\\'ve killed that Vorta jackal when I had the chance. KIRA You want another one? (off Damar\\'s look) Then let\\'s attack Dominion Headquarters. GARAK (agreeing) Chop off a snake\\'s head and its body dies... KIRA Damar -- for the past two years, you practically lived in that building... DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT THREE 36. 46 CONTINUED: DAMAR If you\\'re asking me if I know a way to get us inside, the answer is no -- not without valid security protocols. KIRA Then we\\'ll have to force our way in -- (to Garak) We\\'ll need some kind of explosive device. GARAK I\\'ll get right on it. MILA What you\\'re proposing... is suicide. GARAK Mila, if you don\\'t have anything positive to say... Mila can see that she\\'s not going to talk them out of their plans. MILA I\\'ll prepare some food. No one should die on an empty stomach. And as she heads up the steps -- 46A INT. ANOTHER SECTION OF FIRE CAVES CLOSE ON Dukat wincing with pain as Kai Winn tries to remove an insect stinger from his neck. WINN (annoyed) Be still. DUKAT I am being still. What\\'s taking so long? WINN The stinger is embedded in your skin. DUKAT (temper flaring) I know that. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT THREE 36A. 46A CONTINUED: Dukat winces again. WINN Does it hurt? DUKAT Of course it hurts. Have you ever been stung by a cave-wasp? WINN Not that I recall. I warned you not to slap at it. DUKAT It was annoying me. Squeezing a little harder, Winn manages to pinch the stinger with her nails and yank it out. Dukat GRUNTS with pain. WINN There. Is that better? DUKAT Not really. This Bajoran skin is so... delicate. WINN Then perhaps you should\\'ve stayed a Cardassian. DUKAT Nothing would\\'ve made me happier. But I needed to win your trust. Dukat reaches out and takes Winn\\'s hand. DUKAT And you have to trust me. Only together can we free the Pah- wraiths. Winn doesn\\'t pull her hand away. DUKAT You still care about me, don\\'t you? (a beat) Don\\'t you? Now Winn does pull her hand away. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT THREE 36B. 46A CONTINUED: (2) WINN All I care about is freeing the Pah-wraiths. DUKAT That\\'s not true and you know it. WINN You may look like a Bajoran, but your ego is unmistakably Cardassian. DUKAT I\\'ll take that as a compliment. WINN Of course you will. (a beat) Now do us both a favor... next time you see a cave-wasp, leave it alone. And with that, Winn turns her back to Dukat and continues her trek through the cavern. DUKAT I\\'ll try to remember that. 47 EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL) to see the formidable Dominion, Cardassian and Breen forces, as they prepare for battle. 48 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)(STOCK) to see the Federation invasion fleet move past in formation.

SISKO That the three of us would share a bottle of bloodwine on Cardassia Prime. MARTOK A bottle? I brought a barrel of twenty-three-oh-nine -- there is no finer vintage. ROSS Then I\\'ll meet you two on Cardassia. MARTOK We\\'ll see who gets there first. CLOSE ON Sisko\\'s reaction as Martok and Ross end their transmissions. 53 WIDER as Nog works his panel.

WORF Unable to lock target. The Defiant is ROCKED by a series of hits. One of the N.D.s goes down. Odo quickly takes over his post. ODO We have two Jem\\'Hadar ships coming in behind us, bearing one- three-six mark four. SISKO (to Nog) Evasive action, pattern Delta. NOG Hang on. 56 EXT.

GARAK Of course I don\\'t look well -- I\\'ve been living in a cellar. Mila picks up Damar\\'s empty plate. MILA So has Legate Damar. GARAK What about him? MILA He finished everything on his plate. Which explains why he\\'s such a fine, handsome figure of a man... GARAK I\\'m not sure I follow you. KIRA I do. (re: Damar) Mila -- I believe you\\'re falling in love. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT FOUR 42. 61 CONTINUED: (2) MILA I\\'m old enough to be his mother. DAMAR Nonsense. Mila can\\'t help but being charmed.

Mila heads up the stairs as Kira, Garak and Damar grab their weapons and find cover. 62 INT.

Garak and Damar do the same. 65 ON THE STAIRWAY for a long beat, then Mila\\'s lifeless body comes tumbling down the steps. 66 ANGLE ON GARAK leaps to his feet. GARAK Mila! As Garak reaches the body, a small metal device bounces down the stairs. KIRA Garak -- look out! Garak is caught flat-footed while Damar ducks for cover. Kira moves toward Garak as the device DETONATES, knocking them all unconscious. 67 ANGLE ON THE STAIRWAY as the Jem\\'Hadar and Cardassian soldiers cautiously step down into the cellar and stand over the bodies of our fallen heroes. 68 CLOSE ON KIRA as she groggily tries to shake the cobwebs and crawl to her weapon. But before she can reach it, a Jem\\'Hadar soldier kicks the weapon away, picks her up by the collar, and tosses her into a chair. 69 ANOTHER ANGLE as Garak and Damar are dragged to their feet as well and shoved near Kira.

FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER I don\\'t think so. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT FIVE 51A. 87 CONTINUED: (3) BROCA (shouting) But I\\'ve done everything you\\'ve asked! I tell you -- I\\'m loyal. I believe in the Dominion! And with words falling on deaf ears -- 87A ON WEYOUN watching Broca get dragged out the door. WEYOUN (matter of fact) I won\\'t miss him. FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER I want the Cardassians exterminated. WEYOUN Which ones? FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER All of them. The entire population. WEYOUN That\\'s going to take some time. FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER Then I suggest you begin at once. Weyoun nods and EXITS, ready to carry out his task. 88 EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL) The Dominion fleet disengages the Federation forces and begins to retreat. 89 INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE As before. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT FIVE 52. 89 CONTINUED: WORF Captain -- the Dominion forces are retreating toward Cardassia Prime. A spontaneous CHEER erupts on the Bridge. EZRI Sir -- Admiral Ross and Chancellor Martok would like to speak to you. SISKO I\\'m sure they would. On screen. 90 ANGLE ON THE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL) to see a split screen with Admiral Ross and Martok speaking from their respective ships. ROSS I never thought I\\'d say this, but thank god for the Cardassians. MARTOK As I predicted -- the day is ours. SISKO Not yet it isn\\'t. ROSS Ben, we\\'ve driven the Dominion back to Cardassia Prime. We can keep them bottled-up there indefinitely. SISKO But what if they use that time to rebuild their fleet? MARTOK (agreeing) The Dominion has displayed an ability to build ships at an impressive rate. We must continue our attack. ROSS At what cost? DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT FIVE 53. 90 CONTINUED: ROSS (Cont\\'d) We\\'ve already lost a third of our fleet. MARTOK And we must see to it that those soldiers did not die in vain. SISKO Admiral -- with the Cardassians joining us, we have an opportunity to put an end to this war, once and for all. The Admiral takes a moment to weigh his decision. ROSS All right, gentlemen... we press on. MARTOK My people will sing songs about this moment. 91 ANGLE ON SISKO as the transmission ends. He addresses his crew. SISKO All right, people. You heard the orders. Let\\'s finish what we started. Which leads us to -- 92 INT. BAJORAN FIRE CAVES - MAIN CAVERN (OPTICAL) As a weary Kai Winn and Dukat arrive at the edge of an abyss that stretches beyond them for a quarter kilometer. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT FIVE 54. 92 CONTINUED: DUKAT Let me guess... we\\'re here. WINN We\\'ve reached the end of one journey and stand ready to begin another. 93 DUKAT walks over to the edge of the abyss and looks into it -- WINN What\\'s the matter, Dukat? You look disappointed. 94 ANGLE OVER DUKAT\\'S SHOULDER OF THE ABYSS (OPTICAL) which seems to plunge away into a bottomless pit. DUKAT I know this sounds naive, but I was expecting to see fire... they are called the fire caves. 95 ON KAI WINN as she kneels onto the ground and opens the book of the Kosst Amojan. WINN And with good reason. The Kai closes her eyes, lowers her head, and begins to CHANT. WINN (reading from the book) Lano ka\\'la bo\\'shar lanu no\\'vala, pahrom carana mokado ba\\'jah. Ko\\'se nusso ma\\'kora kajani... lano ka\\'la Kosst Amojan. 96 ANGLE ON THE ABYSS (OPTICAL) as it bursts into flames. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT FIVE 55. 97 ANOTHER ANGLE as Winn looks over to Dukat, who stands in awe at the sight of the fiery canyon. WINN Is that better? Dukat, too overcome to speak, simply nods and smiles with anticipation at what is to come. And on that image, we: FADE OUT. END OF ACT FIVE DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT SIX 56. ACT SIX FADE IN: 98 EXT. CARDASSIA PRIME - DAY (OPTICAL)(STOCK) Re-establishing. 99 INT. CARDASSIAN CELLAR - DAY Kira, Damar and Ekoor are making last minute preparations for their assault on Dominion Headquarters. TWO other Cardassians, both soldiers, are also checking their weapons. EKOOR (to Damar, looking at a PADD) According to this map, it\\'s a long way from the cargo door to the briefing room. KIRA That could be a problem. If we get trapped in one of the corridors -- But before Kira can complete her thought, an OFFSCREEN EXPLOSION rattles the walls, startling everyone. KIRA What the hell -- 100 ANGLE ON GARAK rushing down the stairs. GARAK The Jem\\'Hadar... they\\'re leveling the city, building by building. KIRA (to Damar) We have to go -- now. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT SIX 57. 100 CONTINUED: Damar addresses the rest of the group. DAMAR Once we get inside the complex, we stop at nothing until we capture the changeling. (to all) For Cardassia. The others repeat the refrain: \"FOR CARDASSIA!\" That is, everyone except Kira... and with the SHOUTS still ringing in their ears, Damar leads Ekoor and the two other Cardassians up the steps -- 101 ANGLE ON KIRA about to follow, when she notices Garak standing silently over the tarp-covered body of Mila. KIRA Garak -- GARAK During all my years of exile... I imagined what it would be like to come home... maybe even to live in this house again with Mila. (a beat) But now she\\'s dead and this house is about to become a pile of rubble... (a beat) My Cardassia is gone. KIRA Then fight for a new Cardassia. ANOTHER EXPLOSION -- this one, even louder and closer -- rattles the walls. GARAK I have a better reason than that, colonel. Revenge. And with that, he turns away from Mila and walks past Kira up the stairs. KIRA (to herself) That can work, too. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT SIX 58-60. 101 CONTINUED: And as she follows him up -- 102 thru OMITTED 103 104 INT. BAJORAN FIRE CAVES - MAIN CAVERN (OPTICAL) Winn and Dukat stand before the fiery canyon, the red glow dancing across their faces. 105 ON THE KAI as she ceremoniously takes off her cap and tosses it into the abyss. With equal solemnity, she removes her robe and tosses it over the edge as well (Winn is now wearing only a simple penitent\\'s smock). She takes out the pin holding up her hair, which falls to her shoulders. WINN (smiling) I rid myself of the Prophets and shed a lifetime of hypocrisy. She then turns to Dukat, and to his surprise, grabs him in an embrace and kisses him passionately. DUKAT I\\'ve never seen you looking so radiant... WINN I feel like a young woman, waiting for my lover to sweep me off my feet... DUKAT Do you give yourself willingly to the Pah-wraiths? WINN With all my heart. DUKAT (re: the canyon) Then call to them. Winn breaks their embrace. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT SIX 61. 105 CONTINUED: WINN Bring me the book. Dukat hesitates... he remembers the last time he touched it, he was struck blind. WINN I said, bring it. Dukat overcomes his doubts, picks up the book, and offers it to her. Winn opens the book as Dukat cradles it in his arms. Standing at the very brink of the abyss, Winn begins to chant rapidly. WINN Meek rak dorrah Pah-wran... Yelim cha ono kosst amojan... shay ta- hel ter-rah no\\'vala de-ram... aka\\'lu far che... And off that image -- 106 EXT.

SISKO (to the com) Sisko to Bashir. Report. INTERCUT WITH: 108 INT. DEFIANT - MEDICAL BAY where the bio-beds are all occupied with wounded crewmembers. Two nurses assist Bashir. BASHIR Three dead, eight wounded -- four of them critically. SISKO I need every able-bodied crewman at their post. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT SIX 62. 108 CONTINUED: BASHIR I won\\'t keep anyone here a second longer than I have to. 109 AS SISKO passes by Nog, he offers the helmsman a gentle pat of support on the shoulder. NOG (re: the Defiant) She did pretty well for a first date, don\\'t you think, captain? SISKO I do, ensign. Sisko steps over to Worf and Ezri. WORF Our phaser banks are fully charged, but we\\'re down to only forty-five quantum torpedoes. SISKO That\\'ll have to do. (to Ezri) How\\'re you holding up, old man? EZRI All things considered, I\\'d rather be on Risa. SISKO That makes two of us. Sisko nods a smile and moves over to the other side of the ship where Odo is gazing solemnly at his monitor. ODO (re: the monitor) Have you seen these reports? The Dominion has begun destroying Cardassian cities... millions of people are dying... DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT SIX 63. 109 CONTINUED: NOG (O.S.) Captain -- we\\'re approaching the Dominion defense perimeter. SISKO Let\\'s see what they have waiting for us. On screen. 110 thru OMITTED 111 112 EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL) to see a seemingly impenetrable line of Breen and Jem\\'Hadar ships, defense installations and weapon platforms orbiting Cardassia Prime. This is as formidable and intimidating a sight as we\\'ve ever seen. 112A INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE - CLOSE ON SISKO as he takes in the awesome sight. SISKO Now we know...

CARDASSIAN ALLEY - NIGHT CLOSE ON a large cargo door outside of Dominion Headquarters. ADJUST to REVEAL Kira, Garak, Damar, Ekoor and the other Cardassians that make up this assault team, gathered in the shadows. Garak is studying a Cardassian tricorder. GARAK We have a problem. KIRA Only one? GARAK I\\'m afraid it\\'s a rather large one. The cargo door is made of neutronium. KIRA Then the explosives we brought aren\\'t going to make a dent in it. GARAK You see the problem. EKOOR What do we do? DAMAR I don\\'t know, but I\\'m through hiding in basements... Garak can\\'t suppress a LAUGH. DAMAR I fail to see what\\'s so funny, Garak... GARAK Isn\\'t it obvious? Here we are, ready to storm the castle... willing to sacrifice our lives in a noble effort to slay the Dominion beast in its lair and we can\\'t even get inside the gate. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT SIX 65. 116 CONTINUED: Garak starts LAUGHING again. Ekoor joins in. Even Kira and Damar have to smile. KIRA We could knock on the door and ask the Jem\\'Hadar to let us in... DAMAR Or have them send the Female Shape-shifter out to us. They continue LAUGHING at the absurdity of the moment, but after a beat, the laughter dies. GARAK Like I said, we have a problem... And off Garak\\'s sobering words -- 116A INT. DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM - NIGHT (FORMERLY SCENE 102) The Female Shape-shifter, looking the worse for wear, stands before Thot Pran and his Breen staff. Weyoun is nearby. The Breen General completes his burst of BREEN STATIC. FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER But I\\'ve come to depend on having you here at my side. More Breen STATIC. FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER Your advice has proven invaluable to the Dominion. Another BURST. FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER Very well. If you feel that the situation demands your presence on the front lines, I won\\'t stand in your way. Knowing that you will be leading our troops into battle is very reassuring. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT SIX 65A. 116A CONTINUED: Another BURST OF STATIC, then the General bows to the Female Shape-shifter before leading his staff out the door. 116B ANGLE ON WEYOUN (FORMERLY SCENE 103) who has been watching this exchange with great interest. WEYOUN I still can\\'t help but wonder. FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER Wonder what? WEYOUN What\\'s under that helmet? FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER A braver man than you. (a beat) Though I do find the shrillness of his \"voice\"... tiresome. The Female Shape-shifter turns to walk back to her desk when suddenly, her legs give out from under her. Weyoun barely manages to catch her and keep her on her feet. WEYOUN Founder -- what\\'s wrong? FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER (isn\\'t it obvious?) I\\'m dying, that\\'s what\\'s wrong. WEYOUN Perhaps if you were to rest for a while... revert to your natural state. FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER I haven\\'t been able to change form in weeks. Ironic, isn\\'t it? That I\\'m going to die as a Solid... WEYOUN You\\'re not going to die. You\\'re a god. The Female Shape-shifter looks over at Weyoun. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT SIX 65B. 116B CONTINUED: FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER My loyal Weyoun... the only Solid I\\'ve ever trusted. Weyoun is overwhelmed by this compliment. WEYOUN (bowing) I live only to serve you. FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER And you\\'ve served me well. (a beat, with some bitterness) I don\\'t mind dying. It\\'s knowing that my entire race is dying of the same illness and there\\'s nothing I can do about it... WEYOUN I would give my life to save yours. FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER I only wish it were that simple. And as the Female Shape-shifter allows Weyoun to lead her over to her chair -- 116C EXT. DOMINION HEADQUARTERS - CARGO DOCK - NIGHT Kira, Garak, Damar, Ekoor and the others remain huddled as before, still wrestling with the problem of getting inside Dominion Headquarters. DAMAR What if I were to give myself up? Pretend to be your prisoner. KIRA (shaking her head) They\\'d kill you on sight. GARAK And us along with you. Just then, something offscreen catches Ekoor\\'s eye. EKOOR The cargo door... They all look over to see -- DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT SIX 65C. 117 THE CARGO DOOR has OPENED. Broca and TWO other handcuffed CARDASSIAN SOLDIERS are led out at gunpoint by TWO JEM\\'HADAR. BROCA (to the Jem\\'Hadar) But I haven\\'t done anything wrong! I\\'m not a traitor! Please -- just let me speak to the Founder -- But his pleas fall on deaf ears. As soon as Broca and the other prisoners have taken a few steps into the alley, the Jem\\'Hadar raise their weapons and bayonet them in cold blood. 118 ANGLE ON DAMAR (OPTICAL) leaping to his feet -- DAMAR No! -- and FIRES two shots, killing both Jem\\'Hadar. 119 KIRA AND THE CARDASSIANS rise up en masse and follow Damar as he rushes to the cargo door, which has begun to close.

But he only gets a few steps into the building when he\\'s HIT in the chest by a phaser bolt. 122 NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL) to see a HALF DOZEN JEM\\'HADAR soldiers entering from the other end of the cargo dock and FIRING at the Cardassians. 123 GARAK is bent over Damar\\'s body, then looks up at Kira. GARAK (stunned) He\\'s dead. Kira looks over to see that the Cardassians have taken refuge behind some cargo. She knows that the suddenness of Damar\\'s death has taken the wind out of the Cardassian\\'s sails. KIRA Remember Damar\\'s orders -- we stop for nothing. Garak rises to his feet and addresses his countrymen. GARAK For Cardassia. And with that -- 124 KIRA AND GARAK (OPTICAL) emerge from their hideout FIRING their weapons. The other Cardassians follow suit. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT SIX 67-71. 125 thru OMITTED 135 136 INT. DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM - NIGHT A very worried Weyoun is looking at a monitor. WEYOUN (alarmed) We have a security breach. FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER (unconcerned) The guards will deal with it. The Female Shape-shifter notices that Weyoun doesn\\'t seem very convinced. FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER Is there a problem? WEYOUN (not an easy admission) The guards... there\\'re only a handful left in the building. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT SIX 72. 136 CONTINUED: WEYOUN (Cont\\'d) I sent the rest... (rueful) ... to help eradicate the Cardassians. The sounds of PHASER FIRE grow nearer. WEYOUN (to two of the guards in the room) You two, get out there and see that no one gets through that door. (to the two remaining guards) You, stay here -- in case they fail. And as the two Jem\\'Hadar head for the door -- 136A EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)(STOCK) Re-establishing the Defiant. 136B INT. DEFIANT - BRIDGE (OPTICAL) Sisko is in mid-conversation with Admiral Ross and Chancellor Martok, who are on a split-viewscreen. ROSS We\\'ll launch a three-pronged attack. The Romulans and our new Cardassian allies will engage the Jem\\'Hadar forces... the Klingons will target the Breen... and the Federation will take on the orbital weapon platforms. Any questions? SISKO When do we go? ROSS As soon as everyone\\'s in position. MARTOK It will be a glorious battle. ROSS But a costly one. Estimates project our casualty figures could be as high as forty percent. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT SIX 72A. 136BB ANGLE ON ODO only too aware that his people are responsible for so many deaths. ROSS (continuing) And God knows how much higher they\\'ll go once we send in our ground forces. SISKO The Dominion\\'s beaten and they know it -- but they\\'re going to make us pay for every kilometer of that planet. ROSS Yes, they will... The moment hangs in the air as Sisko, Ross and Martok contemplate the task ahead of them. ROSS Godspeed, everyone. MARTOK Qa\\'pla! And off this moment of shared determination -- 136C INT. DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM - NIGHT as the Female Shape-shifter and Weyoun listen to the SOUND of phaser fire in the hallway outside the Briefing Room. WEYOUN Founder... perhaps we should consider moving to a safer location. FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER And where would that be? Weyoun isn\\'t quite sure, but before he can come up with an answer -- 137 THE DOOR suddenly EXPLODES OPEN. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT SIX 72B. 138 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL) to see Kira, Garak, Ekoor and one other ND Cardassian rush in, FIRING their weapons -- 139 ON THE JEM\\'HADAR (OPTICAL) as one of them takes a hit. However, the other one manages to fire his weapon, killing the ND Cardassian. 140 KIRA (OPTICAL) takes out the last Jem\\'Hadar, then raises her weapon at Weyoun and the Female Shape-shifter. WEYOUN Colonel Kira -- what a pleasant surprise. KIRA The pleasure\\'s all mine. Ekoor moves to a monitor and works the console. EKOOR The Federation fleet has surrounded the planet. KIRA (to the Female Shape-shifter) Contact the Jem\\'Hadar and the Breen, order their ships to stand down. GARAK And order their troops on Cardassia to do the same. FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER I\\'ll do no such thing. Taking his cue from the Female Shape-shifter, Weyoun refuses to appear intimidated. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT SIX 73. 140 CONTINUED: WEYOUN Tell me, where\\'s my old friend, Damar? GARAK Damar\\'s dead. WEYOUN (smiling) A pity. GARAK He died helping to free Cardassia. WEYOUN What\\'s left of it. 141 CLOSE ON GARAK as his anger boils over. He raises his weapon and FIRES, killing Weyoun at point blank range. 142 WIDER as the Female Shape-shifter calmly looks at Weyoun\\'s corpse. FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER I wish you hadn\\'t done that. That was Weyoun\\'s last clone. GARAK I was hoping you\\'d say that. KIRA (to the Female Shape-shifter) This war\\'s over -- you\\'ve lost. FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER Have I? I think you\\'ll find that neither the Jem\\'Hadar nor the Breen would agree with that assessment. They\\'ll fight to the last man. KIRA What will that accomplish? DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT SIX 74. 142 CONTINUED: FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER Isn\\'t it obvious? The Female Shape-shifter, feeling weaker by the moment, moves over to her desk to sit down. FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER (continuing) You may win this war, colonel... but I promise you, by the time it\\'s over, you will have lost so many ships... so many lives -- that your \"victory\" will taste as bitter as defeat. The exhausted Female Shape-shifter leans back in her chair, content with the knowledge that the ultimate victory will be hers. 143 CLOSE ON KIRA as she silently contemplates the Shape-shifter\\'s words, we: FADE OUT.

KIRA Only three of us made it to the Briefing Room. ODO What about Damar? KIRA He\\'s dead. SISKO Is your position secure? KIRA I don\\'t think the Jem\\'Hadar will attack -- they won\\'t risk endangering the Founder. (a beat) She\\'s in pretty bad shape. She won\\'t speak to anyone... just sits at her desk, deteriorating. WORF If she dies before ordering the Jem\\'Hadar to surrender... SISKO (finishing the thought) They\\'ll fight to the last man.

Think of the lives it could save. Sisko thinks about it for a beat, then: SISKO (turning to viewscreen) Commander -- tell the Founder that Odo would like to pay her a visit. And with that, Odo heads to the turbolift -- 147 INT. BAJORAN FIRE CAVES - MAIN CAVERN CLOSE ON a flask of wine being poured into a ceremonial goblet. ADJUST TO REVEAL Kai Winn holding the goblet. Dukat stands near the edge of the abyss, still holding the text of the Kosst Amojan. WINN And now we begin the most important part of the ceremony. Winn then holds the cup above her -- WINN Tarna pur-ono ull-kess pah-ran. lano ka\\'la bo\\'shar lanu. Winn goes to drink from the cup, then hesitates. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT SEVEN 78. 147 CONTINUED: WINN After you. She offers the cup to Dukat who nods. DUKAT I\\'m honored. Dukat gently sets the book down on a ledge and takes the goblet from Winn. Without hesitating, he sips the wine. Winn smiles with pleasure. DUKAT Now you. Winn, still smiling placidly, accepts the cup. But she doesn\\'t drink it. Instead, she slowly, deliberately, pours the wine onto the ground. 148 ON DUKAT as he realizes something is very wrong. But before he can say a word, a wave of intense pain doubles him over. He tries to grab Winn\\'s arm for support, but she takes a step back and Dukat falls to his knees. Mustering his strength, Dukat looks up imploringly at Winn -- DUKAT Why? Winn stretches out her arms -- WINN The Pah-wraiths demand a sacrifice. Someone worthy of them...

DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM - DAY Kira is pacing, waiting for Odo to arrive as Garak stands guarding the Female Shape-shifter. Ekoor is by the door, holding a weapon. 151A ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL) to see Odo MATERIALIZE. Kira rushes up to him. Because of the circumstances, Kira and Odo can\\'t fully express the joy they feel at being together again. ODO Nerys... KIRA It\\'s been a while.

DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT SEVEN 79A. 151A CONTINUED: ODO That\\'s all I need to know. Odo approaches Garak and the Female Shape-shifter. GARAK Constable. ODO Garak. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT SEVEN 80. 151A CONTINUED: (2) FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER You\\'re looking well, Odo. ODO Thank you for seeing me. FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER It\\'s always good to see you. But I have no intention of surrendering my forces. If I did, it would be a sign of weakness... an invitation to the Solids to cross into the Gamma Quadrant and destroy the Great Link. ODO Believe me, I\\'m well aware that the Federation has its flaws... but a desire for conquest isn\\'t one of them. FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER And what of the Klingons and the Romulans... can you make the same claim for them? ODO The Klingon and Romulan Empires are in no shape to wage a war against anyone... besides, the Federation wouldn\\'t allow it. FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER The Dominion has spent the last two years trying to destroy the Federation... and now you\\'re asking me to put our fate in their hands? ODO (simply) Yes. FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER I can\\'t do that, Odo. I don\\'t share your faith in Solids. ODO Perhaps I can change your mind (holding out his hand) Link with me. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT SEVEN 81. 151A CONTINUED: (3) KIRA Odo -- what are you doing? FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER (to Odo) I\\'m afraid I can\\'t Link with you. This disease prevents me from changing form. 152 ON ODO as he steps closer to the Female Shape-shifter and again offers her his hand -- ODO If we Link, I think I can cure you. Garak lifts his gun and points it at Odo. GARAK That\\'s a very bad idea, Constable. KIRA (to Odo, re: Garak) He\\'s right. But Odo keeps his eyes on the Female Shape-shifter. ODO Nerys -- I know what I\\'m doing. (to the Female Shape-shifter) Take my hand. FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER And if you do cure me? What will you ask in return? ODO All I ask is that you Link with me. GARAK I\\'m warning you, Odo... Odo looks to Kira, silently imploring her help. Then after a beat -- KIRA Lower your weapon, Garak. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT SEVEN 81A. 152 CONTINUED: GARAK I don\\'t think so... Kira steps over to Garak, and with her hand, lowers the barrel of his weapon. KIRA I said, put it down. GARAK Why? KIRA Because I trust Odo. She looks over to Odo, who smiles with gratitude. Odo turns back to the Female Shape-shifter, extending his hand once again -- 153 THE FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER (OPTICAL) looks at Odo\\'s hand, then summons her strength to take hold of it. Odo MORPHS his hand around hers. After a few beats, the dry, desiccated flaking that has ravaged the Female Shape-shifter\\'s body begins to disappear. The regeneration travels up her arms, then her body, and finally her face until she\\'s completely healed. Only then does Odo break the Link -- as we HEAR their hands morphing back to their humanoid form. It\\'s immediately apparent that the experience has profoundly changed the Female Shape-shifter. 154 ON GARAK keeping his weapon on the Female Shape-shifter. GARAK Move away, Constable. ODO That won\\'t be necessary. (to the Female Shape-shifter) Will it?

FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER If you\\'ll step aside, I\\'ll order the Jem\\'Hadar to cease fire. Garak hesitates, looking over to Kira, who nods reassuringly. After a beat, Garak lowers his weapon, allowing the Female Shape-shifter to cross over to a monitor and begin working its console. GARAK (re: the Female Shape-shifter) May I suggest securing her in a containment field. ODO Don\\'t worry. She won\\'t try to escape. She\\'s agreed to stand trial for what she\\'s done. KIRA I would\\'ve thought she\\'d insist on going back to the Gamma Quadrant to cure her people. ODO There\\'s no need for that. (off her look) I\\'m going in her place. KIRA For how long? ODO (as gently as possible) Nerys... it\\'s time I rejoined the Great Link. And as Kira absorbs this painful news, we: FADE OUT. END OF ACT SEVEN DEEP SPACE NINE:\"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT EIGHT 84. ACT EIGHT FADE IN: 155 EXT. CARDASSIA - STREET - DAY Rubble, smoke and fires everywhere. Buildings are either collapsed or burnt-out shells. Bodies litter the streets. 156 ANOTHER ANGLE to see Sisko, Martok and Ross standing amid the wreckage; each holding a glass of bloodwine. In his other hand, Martok holds the bottle of bloodwine. MARTOK This is a moment worth savoring. (raising his glass) To victory -- hard fought and well earned. Martok drains his drink, but neither Sisko nor Ross partake. They\\'re too busy looking at the destruction that surrounds them. MARTOK Something wrong? SISKO Suddenly, I\\'m not thirsty. ROSS Neither am I. 157 CLOSER ON MARTOK as he drains his glass. MARTOK Before you waste too many tears... remember, those are Cardassians lying dead at your feet... (re: the devastation) The Bajorans would call this poetic justice... DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT EIGHT 85. 157 CONTINUED: SISKO That still doesn\\'t mean I have to drink a toast over their bodies. With that, Sisko pours his bloodwine onto the ground. Ross does the same, then they both EXIT, leaving Martok alone on the street. The Chancellor shrugs, \"humans -- go figure.\" He then looks at the bottle of bloodwine in his hand, tilts it to his lips, and takes a long swallow. WE HOLD on Martok, looking quite contented, gazing out at the devastation. 158 INT. DOMINION BRIEFING ROOM - DAY CLOSE ON a shocked Bashir. BASHIR Eight hundred million dead... ADJUST TO INCLUDE Garak, who\\'s almost numb at the sense of loss he\\'s experiencing. GARAK And the casualty reports are still coming in... (a beat) Aren\\'t you going to congratulate me, doctor? My exile is officially over. I\\'ve returned home. Or rather, to what\\'s left of it... Bashir looks to ease his friend\\'s suffering. BASHIR I know things must look bleak to you right now, Garak... GARAK (dry) Some may say that we\\'ve gotten exactly what we deserve... after all, we\\'re not exactly \"innocent,\" are we? And I\\'m not just talking about the Bajoran occupation... our entire history is one of arrogant aggression. We collaborated with the Dominion... betrayed the Alpha Quadrant... there\\'s no doubt about it, we\\'re guilty as charged. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT EIGHT 85A. 158 CONTINUED: BASHIR We both know the Cardassians are a strong people... they\\'ll survive... Cardassia will survive. GARAK Doctor, please -- spare me your insufferable Federation optimism. Of course it will survive... but not the Cardassia I knew. We had a rich and ancient culture -- our literature, music, art were second to none. And now, so much of it is lost... So many of our best people... our most gifted minds... BASHIR I\\'m sorry, Garak. I didn\\'t mean.. GARAK (collecting himself) Quite all right, doctor. You\\'ve been a good friend. I\\'m going to miss our lunches together. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT EIGHT 86. 158 CONTINUED: (2) BASHIR I\\'m sure we\\'ll see each other again. GARAK I\\'d like to think so. But who can say... we live in uncertain times. And as Garak gives Bashir one last enigmatic smile, we go to 159 EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL) Re-establishing. 160 INT. WARDROOM The Female Shape-shifter, TWO VORTA and THREE JEM\\'HADAR FIRSTS, are seated at the table signing the official surrender documents. In front of them stand, Sisko, Ross, Martok and a Romulan dignitary. Among the WITNESSES filling the room, are Kira, Odo, Worf, Bashir, O\\'Brien, Ezri and various other STARFLEET OFFICERS, VORTA and JEM\\'HADAR. Once the Female Shape-shifter completes the signing of the surrender documents, she stands and hands them to Admiral Ross. FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER The war between the Dominion and the Federation Alliance is now over. It\\'s a solemn moment. Ross looks up from the documents and addresses the room. ROSS Four hundred years ago, a victorious general spoke the following words at the end of another costly war... And as we PAN the many silent, somber faces in the crowd -- ROSS (continuing) \"Today the guns are silent. A great tragedy has ended... DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT EIGHT 87. 160 CONTINUED: ROSS (Cont\\'d) We have known the bitterness of defeat and the exultation of triumph, and from both we have learned there can be no turning back. We must go forward to preserve in peace what we\\'ve won in war.\" There\\'s a moment of silence. 161 NEW ANGLE (FORMERLY 160A) as TWO FEDERATION SECURITY GUARDS step up behind the Female Shape-shifter. With her usual dignity, she stands and heads for the door. 162 ON THE FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER (FORMERLY 160B) as she pauses in front of Odo. FEMALE SHAPE-SHIFTER It\\'s up to you now, Odo. Odo nods. And without another word, She EXITS. 163 OMITTED 164 INT. PROMENADE (FORMERLY 162) Worf and Ezri are walking down the corridor. EZRI You\\'re coming to Vic\\'s tonight, right? WORF I will be there. But I will not dance. EZRI Who\\'s asking? SISKO (O.S.) Commander Worf. They turn to see -- 165 SISKO, MARTOK, AND ROSS (FORMERLY 162A) approaching. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT EIGHT 87A. 165 CONTINUED: SISKO Can you spare a moment? MARTOK We\\'ve been discussing your plans for the future. WORF I wasn\\'t aware I had plans. ROSS Commander, how would you feel about being named Federation Ambassador to Kronos? Worf looks at the trio to see that they are serious. WORF I am not a diplomat. MARTOK And I am not a politician. But sometimes, fate plays cruel tricks on us. Come, Worf -- Kronos needs you. And what\\'s more, I need you. Worf turns to Ezri. EZRI (re: Martok) You helped him become Chancellor... you can\\'t very well turn your back on him now. Worf then looks at Sisko. WORF My first loyalty is to you, captain. SISKO I\\'ll probably regret this in the morning, but if this is something you want, then by all means... WORF It has been a great honor to serve with you, sir. SISKO The honor was all mine. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT EIGHT 88. 165 CONTINUED: (2) WORF (to Ross and Martok) I accept. MARTOK Excellent. Martok embraces Worf. MARTOK An ambassador who will go targ hunting with me. Maybe being chancellor won\\'t be so bad after all. Martok breaks into a hearty LAUGH. EZRI Congratulations, Worf. Ezri kisses him on the cheek and gives him a congratulatory hug. And off of this moment --- 166 ANGLE ON KIRA AND ODO - SECOND LEVEL (FORMERLY 163) as they walk, deep in discussion. KIRA When will you be going? ODO Soon. KIRA You could come back, you know... after you\\'ve cured your people. ODO I could... One look at Odo tells her that\\'s not what he has in mind. KIRA But you\\'re not going to do that, are you? ODO Nerys... (searching for the words) You know my feelings for you will never change... but my people need me. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT EIGHT 89. 166 CONTINUED: ODO (Cont\\'d) They need to know what I know... learn what I\\'ve learned from living among the Solids. It\\'s the only way they will ever learn to trust you. KIRA You don\\'t have to justify your decision, Odo. There\\'s only one thing I ask. ODO Name it. KIRA I want to go back with you to your homeworld. That way, we can spend your last few days as a Solid together. ODO I\\'d like that. I\\'d like that very much. And off this bittersweet moment -- 167 INT. VIC\\'S LOUNGE (FORMERLY 170) The place is lively. PATRONS are drinking and chatting away as the BAND plays an upbeat, jazzy instrumental. 168 ON THE DOORWAY (FORMERLY 171) as Quark ENTERS and is met by Vic. VIC Hey, pallie -- if you\\'re here for another game of \"go fish,\" I\\'m a little busy right now... QUARK Actually, I\\'m here for the-end-of- the-war-good-bye-Chief-O\\'Brien- good-bye-Odo-good-bye-Worf-party. VIC (pointing) At the bar. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT EIGHT 90. 168 CONTINUED: Quark makes his way over to -- 169 THE BAR (FORMERLY 172) where Sisko, Kasidy, Kira, Odo, Worf, O\\'Brien, Bashir, Ezri and Jake are gathered. BASHIR (decidedly upbeat) ... I\\'m serious, Miles -- I envy you. Going back to Earth... a chance to enjoy paradise again... JAKE Any idea where you\\'re going to live? O\\'BRIEN Not yet. Keiko and I are still mulling over a few possibilities. WORF Have you considered Minsk? O\\'BRIEN I\\'m not sure that\\'s on our list. SISKO New Orleans is a wonderful city. EZRI Jadzia loved Rio. KASIDY I\\'ve heard nice things about Paris. WORF Minsk. ODO (to O\\'Brien) You certainly have a lot of choices. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT EIGHT 90A. 169 CONTINUED: O\\'BRIEN Too many. WORF Minsk. BASHIR Wherever you decide... I\\'m sure you and Keiko will be very happy. But O\\'Brien is already beginning to feel the pain of leaving his friend. O\\'BRIEN Look, Julian... I know that Earth isn\\'t exactly around the corner, but I still expect you to visit me. BASHIR I intend to. O\\'BRIEN Imagine, you and me taking a little trip to Texas. BASHIR (nodding) Standing side by side in front of the Alamo... O\\'BRIEN The real Alamo. (re: their parting) You see? It\\'s going to be great. BASHIR Absolutely. Great. They both nod, trying to convince each other. But they\\'re not fooling anybody. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT EIGHT 91. 169 CONTINUED: (2) QUARK I don\\'t see what\\'s so great about it. Earth\\'s nothing more than a rotating ball of boredom. If you ask me, you\\'d be better off staying right here -- (to Worf and Odo) -- and that goes for you two as well. KIRA Don\\'t tell me you\\'re getting sentimental, Quark... QUARK Me? Not a chance. I just don\\'t like change, that\\'s all. SISKO Well you better get used to it, because things are going to be pretty different around here. For a moment, that gives everyone pause. 169A SISKO (FORMERLY 172) lifts his glass to his crew. SISKO To the best crew any captain ever had. They all lift their glasses. SISKO This may be the last night that we\\'re all together, but no matter what the future holds, no matter how far we travel, a part of us -- a very important part -- will always remain here... on Deep Space Nine. And with that thought in mind, everyone CLINKS glasses. VIC (O.S.) Ladies and gentlemen -- DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT EIGHT 92-93. 170 ANGLE ON THE STAGE (FORMERLY 173) to see Vic standing in front of the band. VIC This is a very special night for some friends of mine. They\\'ve been together a long time. But like the man said, nothing lasts forever. So... (to the group) Gang -- this one\\'s from the heart. And with that, Vic launches into \"The Way You Look Tonight.\" It\\'s an upbeat tune, but the lyrics carry with them a touch of melancholy. And as we pan across their faces, we see that the sentiment isn\\'t lost on our heroes. 170A ON VIC as he finishes the song. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT EIGHT 94. 171 AND THE GROUP sharing a last moment of togetherness. And off this, we go to -- 172 OMITTED 173 INT. BAJORAN FIRE CAVES - MAIN CAVERN (FORMERLY 164) CLOSE ON Dukat\\'s lifeless body. Off-screen, we hear Winn continue to chant -- only now, her voice cracks from exhaustion. WINN (O.S.) Dorra tolka bre-tri pah-wran... ADJUST TO REVEAL Kai Winn looking sweaty, disheveled, and half-insane. WINN (continuing) Dorra tolka o-chen... Dorra tolka wey-sah shay-hal... 174 ANGLE ON THE ABYSS (OPTICAL) (FORMERLY 165) as the FIRES transform into ENERGY PATTERNS that SWIRL overhead. 175 WINN (FORMERLY 166) sees this and her eyes light up with new hope. WINN Ko\\'se nusso ma\\'kora kajani... preen dah-ono uka\\'lamor-eye anu -- (ecstatic) Kosst Amojan -- I await you! Come to me! DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT EIGHT 95. 176 ON THE ENERGY PATTERN (OPTICAL) (FORMERLY 167) as it gathers intensity. Suddenly, an ENERGY SPEAR is released, striking Kai Winn in the chest and flinging her against the rocks. 177 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL) (FORMERLY 168) as a different-looking ENERGY PATTERN plunges into Dukat\\'s open mouth. 178 CLOSE ON DUKAT\\'S EYES (FORMERLY 169) as they pop open, revealing the red-pupils of a Pah- wraith. 179 ANGLE ON KAI WINN coming to consciousness. She looks over toward Dukat -- WINN No... 180 ON DUKAT (FORMERLY 181) as he staggers to his feet. He\\'s been transformed back into a Cardassian and he seems enormously pleased to be his old self again. He then looks over to Winn, who\\'s staring at him with disgust and fear. Dukat smiles at her victoriously. CUT TO: 181 INT. VIC\\'S LOUNGE (FORMERLY 182) CLOSE ON Sisko dancing with Kasidy. Suddenly, he stops moving, a look of concern clouds his face. KASIDY Ben - what\\'s wrong? A shaken Sisko takes a moment to clear his head. SISKO I understand now... KASIDY Understand what? DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT EIGHT 96. 181 CONTINUED: SISKO What I have to do. What I was meant to do. (a beat) Kas -- I have to go... KASIDY (worried) Go? Where? SISKO To Bajor. To the fire caves. KASIDY I\\'ll go with you. SISKO No... 182 CLOSE ON SISKO as he looks over to the bar -- 183 SISKO\\'S POV of Kira, Odo, Worf, Quark, O\\'Brien, Bashir, Ezri... all of them having a good time. 184 BACK TO SISKO as he looks at Kasidy. SISKO I have to do this alone. And with a last look at Kasidy, Sisko EXITS. We HOLD on Kasidy looking after him. 185 EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)(STOCK) (FORMERLY 183) To see a Runabout orbiting Bajor. 186 INT. BAJORAN FIRE CAVES (FORMERLY 184) Sisko makes his way cautiously through the smoky caverns, illuminating his way with the palm beacon attached to his phaser rifle. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT EIGHT 97. 187 ON SISKO (FORMERLY 185) as he enters another cavern, a voice calls out to him -- JAKE (O.S.) Dad... Sisko turns to find -- 188 JAKE (FORMERLY 186) standing among the rocks. SISKO Jake? JAKE You\\'ve got to come back to the station with me. SISKO How\\'d you get here? JAKE It doesn\\'t matter. If you stay here, you\\'ll die. KASIDY (O.S.) He\\'s right, Ben. Sisko looks around to see -- 189 KASIDY (FORMERLY 187) standing at the other side of the cavern wall. KASIDY Our baby\\'s going to need a father. Sisko looks to Kasidy, then back to Jake. SISKO You\\'re not real -- neither one of you... KASIDY But what we\\'re saying is real. JAKE If you try to stop the Restoration, you\\'ll be killed. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT EIGHT 98. 189 CONTINUED: KASIDY You can\\'t defeat the Kosst Amojan. They\\'re too powerful... JAKE Come home, Dad -- you don\\'t belong here. It\\'s not your fight. SISKO I know what you\\'re doing... KASIDY We\\'re trying to help you. SISKO No, you\\'re trying to make me doubt myself... (taking a breath) I won\\'t let you. Sisko turns his back on them and resumes his trek. JAKE Dad... please! KASIDY Ben... don\\'t. But Sisko walks on, ignoring their pleas. 190 INT. BAJORAN FIRE CAVES - MAIN CAVERN (FORMERLY 188) (OPTICAL) The Dukat Pah-wraith stands over Kai Winn, who\\'s still too weak to get to her feet. The book of the Kosst Amojan lies discarded beside her. DUKAT Did you really think the Pah- wraiths would choose you to be their Emissary? Dukat points to the ENERGY TENDRILS swirling over the abyss. DUKAT (dripping with contempt) Soon the Pah-wraiths will burn across Bajor, the Celestial Temple, the Alpha Quadrant... Can you picture it? DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT EIGHT 98A. 190 CONTINUED: DUKAT (Cont\\'d) A universe in flames, burning brightly for all eternity. Suddenly, Dukat smiles to himself, aware of a new presence in the cavern. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT EIGHT 99. 190 CONTINUED: (2) DUKAT The Prophets have sent me a gift. And with that, he turns to look at -- 191 SISKO (OPTICAL) (FORMERLY 189) standing in the cavern beneath them. DUKAT Their beloved Emissary... sent forth like an avenging angel to slay the demon. SISKO I should\\'ve known the demon would be you. Dukat raises his arms -- DUKAT Go on -- kill me if you can. Sisko raises his rifle, but before he can take aim, an unseen force yanks the weapon out of his hand and flings it against the rocks. DUKAT Come now, captain... you\\'ll have to do better than that. 192 DUKAT (OPTICAL) (FORMERLY 190) stretches out his hand, discharging an invisible ENERGY BOLT which knocks Sisko to the ground. DUKAT This is too easy. 193 SISKO (FORMERLY 191) shakes the cobwebs and gets to his feet. Then mustering his strength, Sisko climbs the rock steps to the ledge where Dukat stands. DUKAT That\\'s right. Come closer. Sisko reaches the ledge. Then using both hands as a club, he pummels at Dukat -- but his blows have no effect. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT EIGHT 100. 193 CONTINUED: DUKAT Satisfied? (smiling) Now bow to me. But Sisko just glares at him. DUKAT I said bow -- And suddenly, a force drives Sisko to his knees. But Sisko refuses to cower. SISKO You\\'re pathetic. DUKAT Am I? Then why are you the one on your knees? SISKO First the Dominion... now the Pah-wraiths... you have a talent for picking the losing side. Dukat stretches out his hand again, doubling Sisko over in pain. DUKAT Benjamin... please. We\\'ve known each other too long. And since this is the last time we\\'ll ever be together -- let\\'s try to speak honestly. (a beat) In the past, we\\'ve both had our share of victories and defeats... but now it\\'s time to resolve our differences and face the ultimate truth -- I\\'ve won, and you\\'ve lost. SISKO (persisting) The Pah-wraiths aren\\'t going to conquer anything. Not Bajor. Not the Celestial Temple. And certainly not the Alpha Quadrant. DUKAT And who\\'s going to stop us? SISKO I am. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT EIGHT 101. 193 CONTINUED: (2) DUKAT You? (laughing) You can\\'t even stand up. WINN (O.S.) Then I\\'ll stop you -- They turn to see -- 194 KAI WINN (FORMERLY 192) standing at the edge of the abyss, holding the text of the Kosst Amojan. She rears back to toss the book into the fiery abyss, but before she can -- 195 DUKAT (FORMERLY 193) raises his hand and the book is plucked out of her hand and flies into his. DUKAT (to Winn) Are you still here? 196 ON WINN (OPTICAL) (FORMERLY 194) turning to Sisko -- WINN Emissary, the book... But before she can finish, an ENERGY TENDRIL snakes out of the abyss, wraps itself around her and bursts into flames, consuming her in seconds. 197 ON DUKAT (FORMERLY 195) clutching the book and smiling contentedly at Winn\\'s fate. DUKAT Farewell, Adami. And as he turns back toward Sisko -- 198 SISKO (OPTICAL) (FORMERLY 196) launches himself at Dukat, tackling him around the waist, and sending them both hurtling over the ledge and into the abyss. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT EIGHT 102. 199 ON THE ABYSS (OPTICAL) (FORMERLY 197) as Sisko, Dukat and the text of the Kosst Amojan plummet down into the infinite depths of the flaming caverns. And as their tumbling bodies fall, a bright FLASH of light WHITES OUT the screen -- 200 INT. WHITE LIMBO (OPTICAL) (FORMERLY 198) Sisko looks around, trying to get his bearings. His HEARTBEAT and BREATHING are magnified. SISKO Sarah? Are you here? What happened? ADJUST to include Sarah/Prophet. SARAH PROPHET The Emissary has completed his task. SISKO But the Pah-wraiths... SARAH PROPHET You\\'ve returned them to their prison within the fire caves. SISKO The book was the key, wasn\\'t it? SARAH PROPHET To a door that can never be opened again. SISKO And Dukat? Is he dead? SARAH PROPHET He\\'s where he belongs... with the Pah-wraiths. (with a smile) Your time of trial has ended. You need to rest now. SISKO I intend to. As soon as I get back to Deep Space Nine. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT EIGHT 103. 200 CONTINUED: SARAH PROPHET That won\\'t be necessary... Just then, SEVERAL FIGURES emerge from the mists behind Sarah. They are other Prophets, taking the form of Kira, Worf, Odo, Bashir, Ezri, Martok and Ross. SARAH PROPHET You\\'re with us now. 201 CLOSE ON SISKO (FORMERLY 199) as the meaning of her words sink in. And we: FADE OUT.

EZRI We found the captain\\'s runabout orbiting Bajor. WORF (to Kasidy) But when we scanned the fire caves, there was no sign of him. Bashir comes over with a cup of tea for Kasidy. BASHIR Here. Tarkalian tea -- very soothing. EZRI (sotto, to Bashir) Better keep it coming. JAKE You\\'re not calling off the search yet, are you? ODO Not until we find your father. JAKE What about Kendra Province, where he bought that land. Maybe he went there for some reason... WORF Colonel Kira and Chief O\\'Brien have just completed another scan of the planet. As far as they can tell, he\\'s not there. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT NINE 105. 203 ANGLE ON KASIDY (OPTICAL) She finally speaks, voicing the dread building inside her. KASIDY Something\\'s happened to Ben. Something bad... I can feel it. The Prophets warned us. And as she looks at Jake, the screen WHITES OUT -- 204 INT. WHITE LIMBO (OPTICAL) (FORMERLY 209) Kasidy, somewhat frightened and bewildered, looks around trying to get her bearings. KASIDY Hello? Is anyone here? We HEAR her magnified heartbeat and breathing. Then the sound of a VOICE, softly whispering her name in the wind. KASIDY Ben? Is that you? SISKO (O.S.) Kasidy. Kasidy turns to see Sisko, standing behind her. The moment she sees her husband, she rushes into his arms. KASIDY Ben! I was so worried... (looking around at the whiteness surrounding them) Where are we? SISKO The Celestial Temple. She steps away to get a better look at him. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT NINE 106-106A. 204 CONTINUED: KASIDY This is scaring me -- let\\'s go home. SISKO I can\\'t. Not now. KASIDY Why not? Kasidy can see that Sisko doesn\\'t have an easy answer to that question. KASIDY Oh, God... this is it, isn\\'t it? The sorrow the Prophets warned us about... SISKO It\\'s difficult to explain... it isn\\'t linear... KASIDY What isn\\'t? SISKO My life... my destiny... the Prophets saved me, Kas -- I\\'m their Emissary, and they still have a great deal for me to do. But first, there\\'s a lot I have to learn... things only the Prophets can teach me. KASIDY When will you be back? SISKO It\\'s hard to say. Time doesn\\'t exist here. It could be a year. It could be yesterday. (definitively) But I will be back. Kasidy finds reassurance in Sisko\\'s eyes. KASIDY I\\'ll be waiting. Sisko takes Kasidy in his arms and kisses her. And as they hold each other tight, the screen WHITES OUT again -- DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT NINE 107. 204 CONTINUED: (2) JAKE (O.S.) Kas? Can you hear me?

He takes a last look around the now empty room, making sure they didn\\'t leave anything behind. His eye snags on something on the ground and he reaches down to pick up a FIGURINE from his Alamo Model -- it\\'s Colonel Travis. He smiles, and we -- DISSOLVE INTO A MONTAGE SEQUENCE: 208 SERIES OF CLIPS (FORMERLY 211S) (TBD) featuring O\\'Brien and Bashir. CUT TO: 209 INT.

We PUSH in on his face and -- DISSOLVE TO: DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT NINE 109. 216 SERIES OF CLIPS (TBD) (FORMERLY SCENE 211ZA) featuring scenes that include our entire cast, including the Promenade walk from \"Badda Bing,\" the all-for-one-and-one-for-all moment from \"Take Me out to the Holosuite,\" etc. 217 INT. AIRLOCK CORRIDOR Bashir and O\\'Brien are standing there, unable to say good-bye. A moment as the two regard each other, realizing that words could never do justice to their friendship. They extend their hands to shake, a beat, then they pull each other into a bear-hug. CUT TO: 218 INT. PROMENADE Worf, carrying a bag and a bat\\'leth strapped over his shoulder, walks with Martok toward the airlock. Martok is talking enthusiastically about the future of the Klingon Empire (of course, we don\\'t hear any of this -- only the musical score is playing). But a somber Worf has other things on his mind at the moment. Martok steps through the airlock door, but Worf hesitates on the steps, taking a moment to have one last look at the station that\\'s come to mean so much to him. Scanning the area, he looks up to see -- 219 WORF\\'S POV OF EZRI standing on the second level, watching him leave. After a beat, she lifts her hand in farewell. 220 ON WORF as he returns the gesture. A beat later, he disappears into the airlock. 221 INT. SISKO\\'S QUARTERS Jake, sitting on the couch, places the roof onto the model house. After a beat, he smiles. The MUSIC FADES OUT AND THE MONTAGE SEQUENCE ENDS. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT NINE 110-110A. 222 thru OMITTED 225 226 INT. CORRIDOR (FORMERLY 175) as Odo and Kira make their way to one of the airlocks. KIRA Are you sure you want to leave without saying good-bye? ODO Quite sure. I\\'m not very good at good-byes. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT NINE 111. 226 CONTINUED: KIRA A lot of people are going to be disappointed. ODO If they don\\'t know how I feel about them now, a few parting words won\\'t make any difference. Just as they reach the airlock, a voice calls out to them -- QUARK (O.S.) I knew it! They turn to see Quark hurrying over to them. QUARK When I saw the two of you slip out of the holosuite, I said to myself, \"That no-good, misanthropic, cantankerous, changeling is trying to sneak off the station without anyone noticing.\" ODO That was the idea. QUARK Well, it\\'s not going to happen. ODO Apparently not. QUARK So now that I\\'m here... isn\\'t there something you want to say to me? ODO Such as? QUARK Such as, \"Good-bye, you certainly were a worthy adversary\" -- or maybe something with the words \"mutual respect\" in it... ODO No. QUARK No? What do you mean \"no?\" DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT NINE 112. 226 CONTINUED: (2) ODO There\\'s nothing I want to say to you. QUARK You\\'re telling me that after all these years... after all we\\'ve been through, you\\'re not even going to say good-bye to me? ODO That\\'s right. Odo and Quark stare each other down for a long beat. Finally, Odo looks to Kira -- ODO Nerys... I\\'ll be on the Runabout. And with a final dismissive glance at Quark, Odo steps around him and into the airlock. 227 ON QUARK AND KIRA (FORMERLY 176) watching him disappear into the runabout. QUARK I guess that\\'s it then... KIRA Don\\'t take it so hard, Quark -- QUARK Hard? What are you talking about? (breaking into a smile) That man loves me -- couldn\\'t you see? It was written all over his back. And with that, Quark heads back down the corridor. And as Kira follows Odo into the runabout, we go to: 228 EXT. ATOLL - DAY (OPTICAL) (FORMERLY 200) Kira and Odo are standing on a small outcropping of rock, surrounded by a vast ocean of Shape-shifters in their gelatinous state. We\\'re on the Dominion homeworld -- the changeling planet we saw in \"Broken Link.\" However, this time, the Shape-shifter ocean is discolored -- evidence of the illness that\\'s affecting the Great Link. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT NINE 113. 228 CONTINUED: KIRA The Link... it looks different. ODO They\\'re dying. KIRA You should go to them. Odo nods, but he has something to say to her first. ODO Nerys, tell the captain... and the others... I\\'m going to miss them. KIRA (half-smiling) Even Quark? ODO Even Quark. (looking into her eyes) But most of all... She holds up her hand to stop him. KIRA I know. They kiss. It\\'s a long, passionate embrace. Whatever they have to say to each other, they\\'re saying it right now. Finally, they break the embrace. 229 ANGLE ON ODO (OPTICAL) (FORMERLY 201) as he MORPHS his clothes into a tuxedo. KIRA What\\'s that for? ODO You always said I looked good in a tuxedo. KIRA You do. ODO Then that\\'s how I want you to remember me... DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT NINE 114. 229 CONTINUED: Kira can\\'t help smiling as she straightens his bow tie. KIRA I\\'ll remember this moment forever. (a beat) I\\'ll remember all our moments... ODO As will I. They stare at each other a beat. ODO Good-bye, Nerys. 230 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL) (FORMERLY 202) as Odo turns away and walks calmly into the sea of changelings. He turns back to look at Kira one last time. 231 CLOSER ON ODO (OPTICAL) (FORMERLY 203) as he raises his hand in farewell. 232 KIRA (FORMERLY 204) raises her hand in response. 233 ODO (OPTICAL) (FORMERLY 205) then MORPHS into his gelatinous state. As he does, the goo around him begins to softly ripple and change colors, regaining its healthy golden glow. 234 ON KIRA (OPTICAL) (FORMERLY 206) standing alone on the atoll, surrounded by the vast undulating changeling sea. CUT TO: 235 INT. CAPTAIN\\'S OFFICE (FORMERLY 212) The dawning of a new day. CLOSE ON Nog ENTERING with a PADD. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT NINE 115. 235 CONTINUED: NOG Today\\'s duty roster, colonel. ADJUST ANGLE to REVEAL Kira sitting in the Captain\\'s Chair. Nog hands her the PADD, which she glances at. KIRA Nice work. (then looking up) And congratulations on your promotion, lieutenant. NOG (grinning) Thank you, sir. I guess putting me in for promotion was one of Captain Sisko\\'s last official acts. KIRA I\\'m sure he\\'s very proud of you, Nog. NOG I\\'d like to think so, sir. KIRA Now about the cargo inventories... NOG I\\'ll get right on it. And with that, Nog EXITS. We HOLD on Kira as she gets up from behind the desk, picks up Sisko\\'s baseball and EXITS into -- 236 INT. OPS (FORMERLY 213) where she stands at the head of the stairs, tossing the baseball. Kira looks around the room -- 237 KIRA\\'S POV - OF ALL THE NEW FACES (FORMERLY 214) manning the stations. 238 ON KIRA (FORMERLY 215) as she glances at the baseball, thinking about Captain Sisko. After a beat, she smiles. CUT TO: DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT NINE 116. 239 INT. PROMENADE (FORMERLY 216) Bashir and Ezri are walking down the Promenade. BASHIR ... the thing of it is, I thought the cardiac apoptosis would lead to terminal coronary failure, but in actuality -- and here\\'s the really interesting part -- the apoptosis was part of the normal cardiac renewal process. Bashir ends with a self-satisfied nod. BASHIR What do you think? EZRI I think maybe tonight, after dinner, we could go to Quark\\'s... spend some time in a holosuite. BASHIR I wouldn\\'t mind a little trip to Vegas... EZRI Actually, I was thinking about the Alamo. BASHIR We can\\'t go there. EZRI Why not? BASHIR That was something Miles and I did. (brightening) But we could try a new program I got... The Battle of Thermopylae. (off her blank look) You know, where a small band of Spartans led by King Leonidas defended a mountain pass against the vast Persian army. EZRI What happened then? BASHIR For two days, the Spartans put up a heroic struggle. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT NINE 116A. 239 CONTINUED: EZRI Until they were wiped out. BASHIR How\\'d you know? EZRI Lucky guess. I take it we\\'ll be the Spartans? BASHIR Fighting to the last man. DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT NINE 117 239 CONTINUED: (2) EZRI Just like the Alamo. BASHIR Exactly. Ezri looks at him for a beat. EZRI Have you ever talked to a counselor about these annihilation fantasies? BASHIR You think I should? EZRI I\\'ll set up a session for tomorrow. BASHIR But tonight... EZRI Tonight we defend the pass. Bashir smiles; this is love. And this moment leads us to -- 240 INT. QUARK\\'S (FORMERLY 217) The usual midday crowd. Quark places a small vial in front of Morn. QUARK That\\'ll be ten strips of latinum. Morn is about to say something -- QUARK I know, I know -- I\\'ll put it on your tab. Morn then picks up the bottle and studies it carefully. QUARK Don\\'t worry, it\\'s guaranteed to grow hair within a week. Though if you ask me, that dome of yours is hairy enough. Besides, hasn\\'t there been enough change around here already? DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT NINE 118. 240 CONTINUED: KIRA (O.S.) Quark! He turns to see -- 241 AN ANGRY KIRA (FORMERLY 218) approaching, holding a PADD. KIRA You mind explaining this? Looking at the PADD. QUARK That\\'s this week\\'s betting pool... KIRA You\\'re taking bets on who\\'s going to be the new Kai? QUARK It\\'s a wide open field. Just between you and me, the smart money\\'s on Vedek Ungtae. KIRA Well just between you and me -- all bets are off. QUARK What are you talking about? KIRA As of this moment, betting pools of any kind are illegal on this station. I catch someone placing a bet, and you\\'ll spend fifteen days in a holding cell. Is that clear? QUARK (dry) Fifteen days... can I bring my own pillow? KIRA Quark! DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT NINE 119. 241 CONTINUED: QUARK It\\'s clear, it\\'s clear. KIRA It better be. And without another word, Kira EXITS. We HOLD on Quark and Morn. QUARK It\\'s like I said, the more things change, the more they stay the same. And as Quark goes back to work -- 242 INT. PROMENADE (FORMERLY 219) to see Kira walk down the busy Promenade. The CAMERA slowly RISES above the crowd and PANS OVER to find -- 243 A SOMBER JAKE (FORMERLY 220) standing on the second level of the Promenade, looking out one of the windows. 244 JAKE\\'S POV -- OF THE WORMHOLE (OPTICAL) (FORMERLY 221) which suddenly BURSTS OPEN, allowing a ship to enter. Like always, it\\'s a magical sight. 245 CLOSE ON JAKE (FORMERLY 222) thinking about how much he misses his father. A hand COMES INTO FRAME and lightly grips his shoulder. WE WIDEN TO REVEAL -- 246 KIRA (FORMERLY 223) standing beside him. She knows what he\\'s feeling and wants him to know he\\'s not alone. They exchange a brief smile, then gaze back out the window... DEEP SPACE NINE: \"What You... \" - REV. 04/26/99 - ACT NINE 120. 247 EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL) (FORMERLY 224) Looking in on Jake and Kira, standing by the window. The CAMERA SLOWLY begins to pull back, past the usual station shot and continuing further and further away... the station becoming smaller and smaller and smaller still... until finally, Deep Space Nine becomes just one more bright, but distant star in the vast, cathedral of space. FADE OUT. END OF ACT NINE THE END'"

STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE \"In the Hands of the Prophets\" TEASER FADE IN: 1 INT. PROMENADE at the Kiosk - close on a glop on a stick in a VENDOR\\'s hand... KEIKO (O.S.) Too early for me... Moving with the glop to reveal O\\'BRIEN who takes it... O\\'BRIEN You sure? KEIKO (makes a face) It\\'s so sweet. O\\'BRIEN It\\'s a natural sweetness from the sap of the jumja tree... filled with vitamin C. He takes a lick. They move away from the Kiosk. KEIKO Since when did you become such an expert on jumja sticks? O\\'BRIEN Hmm? Oh, Neela told me. The name Neela gets a subtle response from Keiko. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/05/93 - TEASER 2. 1 CONTINUED: KEIKO Did she... ? (beat) So. Is she working out any better than the last one? O\\'BRIEN Neela? She\\'s terrific. She\\'s even taught me a few things. KEIKO (very dry) I\\'m glad to hear her expertise doesn\\'t end with jumja sticks... O\\'BRIEN (slow on the uptake) Oh yeah, she\\'s a good engin... (now he realizes) hold on... KEIKO What? O\\'BRIEN You\\'re not thinking... She keeps walking, poker faced... O\\'BRIEN Keiko... She smiles, satisfied, secure in her marriage... KEIKO (teasing) Just keeping you on your toes, O\\'Brien. O\\'BRIEN Very funny, O\\'Brien. KEIKO (flirtatious) Be careful who you share your jumja with... Smiles sexily and walks away... off O\\'Brien\\'s reaction... DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - 04/02/93 - TEASER 3. 2 EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL) The wormhole illuminates in the background as a ship goes through. KEIKO (V.O.) Now, as we discussed in yesterday\\'s lesson, the wormhole was discovered by Commander Sisko and Lieutenant Dax earlier this year. After a beat, PULL BACK TO REVEAL... that in fact, we\\'re in... 2A OMITTED 3 INT. SCHOOLROOM - KEIKO (OPTICAL) is standing in front of a large monitor/blackboard with the wormhole displayed. As usual, most of Keiko\\'s students are Bajoran, with a handful of humans and other aliens. JAKE is present, but Nog is not. As she moves away from the monitor... KEIKO (continuing) Does anyone know what makes this wormhole so unusual? Jake raises his hand... KEIKO Jake? JAKE It\\'s stable... ? 4 NEW ANGLE As Keiko speaks, a Bajoran woman ENTERS the schoolroom. The woman, VEDEK WINN, is dressed in religious garb similar to, but easily distinguishable from, the clothing worn by the monks on the station. In attitude and bearing, Winn comes across like your favorite aunt: helpful, sympathetic, and caring. The Vedek stands quietly at the back of the class like a principal observing... DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - 04/02/93 - TEASER 3A. 4 CONTINUED: KEIKO (continuing) It\\'s stable, that\\'s right, Jake... it\\'s the first stable wormhole known to exist... Keiko notices the Vedek... smiles an acknowledgement, as she continues the lesson, curious about her... the Vedek nods hello... DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/08/93 - TEASER 4. 4 CONTINUED: (2) WINN (smiles, I don\\'t wish to interrupt) Please... continue... KEIKO (nods) A stable wormhole is very important because it allows us to travel secure in the knowledge that neither end will shift location. Who knows why the wormhole is stable... ? The students seem disconcerted by the presence of a stranger... no one raises their hand... KEIKO Because it was artificially constructed. Commander Sisko encountered the entities who created the wormhole when he... WINN Excuse me, by the \"entities,\" do you not mean \"the prophets\"... ? KEIKO (beat, senses the issue) Yes... on Bajor... the entities are worshipped as prophets. (beat, moving quickly on) Our studies of the wormhole have shown that it was formed by unique particles we call verterons that are apparently self-sustaining... this begins to explain how a ship at impulse can safely pass through... WINN Ships are safely guided through the passage by the hands of the prophets. KEIKO (beat) In a manner of speaking... DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/05/93 - TEASER 5. 4 CONTINUED: (3) WINN (deceptively sweet) Not apparently your manner of speaking... This has gone too far in front of the children... KEIKO Perhaps we should discuss this after... WINN Do you believe the celestial temple of the prophets exists within the passage... ? KEIKO I respect that the Bajoran people believe it does. WINN But that\\'s not what you teach. Keiko understands now that there is to be no avoiding this. Firm, confident, but not aggressively and without hostility -- KEIKO No, I don\\'t teach Bajoran spiritual beliefs. That\\'s your job. Mine is to open the children\\'s minds... to history... to literature... to mathematics... to science... Winn sounds sad. Like she is deeply hurt by what she is being forced to say. WINN (very apologetic) You are opening the children\\'s minds... to blasphemy. And I cannot permit it to continue. Her strong eyes study... DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - 04/02/93 - TEASER 6. 5 KEIKO We hold on Keiko\\'s troubled expression for a moment, then we... FADE OUT. END OF TEASER DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/05/93 - ACT ONE 7. ACT ONE FADE IN: (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) 6 INT. SECURITY OFFICE (VPB) NEELA, O\\'Brien\\'s Bajoran apprentice, works on something inside an open panel under the security monitors (which are blank). Neela is in her early twenties, bright, pretty, and eager to please. O\\'Brien ENTERS, carrying his tool case. O\\'BRIEN Sorry I couldn\\'t get here sooner. Another fusion reactor went down. How\\'s it going? Neela keeps working, she tweaks a few things, and then... NEELA Done. O\\'BRIEN (pleasantly surprised) Done? (off her nod) Did you remember to re-initialize the isolinear co-processor? NEELA (nods again) I did it exactly like you showed me. Should I test it? O\\'BRIEN Let me. You know us old folks. We like to feel useful. O\\'Brien keys in some commands on Odo\\'s security desk and the wall monitors come back to life. O\\'BRIEN Not bad, not bad at all. (to Neela, kidding) If you keep this up, I\\'m going to be out of a job. NEELA (smiles) I doubt that. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - 04/02/93 - ACT ONE 8-8A. 6 CONTINUED: O\\'BRIEN Let\\'s close her up. 6A NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL) O\\'Brien and Neela place the panel back in place. Neela takes a small high tech tool and plays it over the edge of the panel. O\\'BRIEN (re: the tool) Not that one... this is a security seal. You need an E-J-Seven Interlock to open or close it. NEELA (confused) E-J-Seven? Neela looks at her tool kit. O\\'BRIEN (goes for his own tool box) Never mind... I\\'ve got one. 6B BACK TO SCENE O\\'Brien searches his tool box, but he can\\'t find what he\\'s looking for. He double-checks, but it\\'s not there. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/05/93 - ACT ONE 9. 6B CONTINUED: O\\'BRIEN Bloody hell. NEELA What\\'s wrong? O\\'BRIEN My E-J-Seven. It\\'s missing. NEELA Maybe you left it in Ops. O\\'BRIEN (beat, shakes his head) I don\\'t misplace my tools. On his concerned expression... 7 INT. COMMANDER\\'S OFFICE Keiko is talking to SISKO. He\\'s grim, concerned. SISKO I\\'m not exactly surprised. KEIKO You knew this was going to happen? SISKO A confrontation like this was inevitable. (rises) Sometimes, I wonder if we\\'ll ever find the common ground we need to bring Bajor into the Federation. Sisko opens the door to Ops... calls to Kira -- DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/05/93 - ACT ONE 10. 7 CONTINUED: SISKO Major, would you join us? Kira comes in... SISKO We\\'ve been talking about an incident this morning at the school... KIRA I heard... Vedek Winn has been meeting with some of the Bajoran civilians about it... Sisko frowns... SISKO What do you know about her? KIRA She\\'s from an orthodox order... she has some support to become the next Kai... but probably not enough... KEIKO The question is how much support does she have on this station? KIRA (casual) She has mine. Sisko reacts... KEIKO You can\\'t possibly believe teaching the facts about the wormhole amounts to blasphemy... KIRA (not hostile) I think some revisions in the school curriculum might be appropriate... you teach a lot of Bajoran children... DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/05/93 - ACT ONE 11. 7 CONTINUED: (2) KEIKO (confrontational) I\\'m not going to let a Bajoran spiritual leader dictate what can or can\\'t be taught in my classroom... Kira reacts, obviously she\\'s dealing with a closed mind here... looks to Sisko... KIRA (to Sisko) Then maybe we need two schools on this station... one for Bajoran children and another for the Federation... Sisko sighs, a beat... SISKO If we start separating Bajoran and Federation interests... KIRA A lot of Bajoran and Federation interests are separate, Commander... I\\'ve been telling you that all along. SISKO Nobody\\'s saying there can\\'t be spiritual teaching on this station, Major... but why can\\'t it be in addition to what\\'s taught in Mrs. O\\'Brien\\'s classroom... KIRA But if she\\'s teaching a fundamentally different philosophy... KEIKO I\\'m not teaching any philosophy... I\\'m trying to teach pure science... DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/05/93 - ACT ONE 12. 7 CONTINUED: (3) KIRA Some might say pure science, taught without a spiritual context, is a philosophy, Mrs. O\\'Brien... Keiko is very frustrated... SISKO My philosophy is that there is room for all philosophies on this station. (beat, to Kira) How do you suggest we deal with this? KIRA I\\'m not sure you can. The \"you\" is deliberate. There is no we yet. 7A thru OMITTED 7B 8 INT. PROMENADE Activity as usual... finding Sisko entering the Bajoran Shrine. A Bajoran monk, dressed in vestments similar to Winn\\'s, steps aside to let Sisko in. 9 INT. BAJORAN SHRINE An ornate candlelit interior. A string instrument (audio only) making soft, pulsating sounds adds to the mystical feeling. Vedek Winn is bowing her head before a shrine, cupping her ear in a ritual gesture with her eyes closed... as Sisko moves inside, reluctant to disturb her. Without opening her eyes to see him, she speaks... DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/05/93 - ACT ONE 13. 9 CONTINUED: WINN I can\\'t tell you how much I\\'ve looked forward to this moment. Now, she opens her eyes and turns to him... WINN I\\'m honored to meet the Emissary to the prophets. SISKO If you\\'d let me know you were coming, Vedek Winn, I would have greeted you sooner. WINN Pardon me, Emissary... I did not wish to bother you with my insignificant visit... SISKO I\\'d hardly call it insignificant. WINN (deliberately mistaken as a compliment) Thank you, Emissary. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/05/93 - ACT ONE 14. 9 CONTINUED: (2) SISKO I wish you wouldn\\'t call me that... I\\'m Commander Sisko... or Benjamin, if you\\'d like... WINN But you are the Emissary. Don\\'t you know the cherished place you\\'ve earned in the Bajoran spiritual life... ? SISKO I\\'m not sure I\\'m comfortable in that role. WINN The course the prophets choose for us may not always be comfortable. But we must follow it. Her hand reaches toward his ear... pauses... WINN May I? Sisko doesn\\'t stop her... she presses the ear as the Kai did in the pilot... they study each other for a long beat... nods... WINN Still the disbeliever. (beat) I once asked Kai Opaka why a disbeliever was destined to seek the prophets. She told me one should never look into the eyes of one\\'s own gods. (shakes her head) I disagreed. I told her I would do anything to look into their eyes. She suggested that I sit in darkness for a day and quite properly so. She cannot be replaced. I miss her deeply. SISKO (beat) It\\'s important to me that we resolve your problems with the school. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/05/93 - ACT ONE 15. 9 CONTINUED: (3) WINN The prophets have spoken to me through the orbs, Emissary. I understand my duty to defend the Bajoran faith. The teacher has dishonored the celestial temple. If she does not recant, I cannot be responsible for the consequences. Hold on Sisko\\'s reaction for a moment, then... 10 thru OMITTED 13 FADE OUT. END OF ACT ONE DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/05/93 - ACT TWO 16. ACT TWO FADE IN: 14 INT. OPS (VPB) O\\'Brien and Neela are at work at the Engineering station. We join them in mid-conversation. NEELA This still seems like an awful lot of trouble to go through to find one tool. O\\'BRIEN With that Interlock, someone could access every critical system on the station. As she acknowledges... DAX comes over... DAX Chief, have you seen Ensign Aquino recently? O\\'BRIEN (looks around Ops) No... now that you mention it. DAX He didn\\'t report for duty this morning. The computer says he\\'s not on the station, but he didn\\'t log out. O\\'BRIEN (worried) Have you talked to Odo? DAX I guess I\\'d better. She EXITS to the Turbolift... NEELA Scanners are ready. O\\'BRIEN Computer, show location of any independent tritanium sources... DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/08/93 - ACT TWO 17. 15 ANGLE - MONITOR (VPB) Looking at the monitor... NEELA Level three, section five... O\\'BRIEN That\\'s the tool locker... I\\'ve been through everything in there three times... O\\'Brien presses another panel... the image on the monitor changes... O\\'Brien reacts as he looks at the monitor... O\\'BRIEN Now what\\'s that? NEELA Looks like something in a power conduit on level twelve, section eight. O\\'BRIEN What would tritanium be doing in there? (thoughtful beat) Computer, shut down that conduit... reroute the power flow. COMPUTER Conduit deactivated. O\\'BRIEN (to Neela) Come on... They EXIT... 16 thru OMITTED 17 18 INT. POWER CONDUIT O\\'Brien uses a tricorder to scan the Jefferies tube-like power conduit. Behind him, Neela scans the other side. NEELA Over here, Chief. O\\'Brien joins Neela and examines a pile of slag on the floor of the conduit. He scans it with his tricorder. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/05/93 - ACT TWO 18-20. 18 CONTINUED: O\\'BRIEN It\\'s a tritanium composite, all right. Looks like our missing Interlock. NEELA It must have been melted by the conduit\\'s plasma flow. O\\'BRIEN (while continuing his scan) That still doesn\\'t explain how it got here in the first place. (notices something on his tricorder) Huh... Neela looks over his shoulder at the display. O\\'BRIEN (continuing) I\\'m picking up traces of organic material. Neela runs her own tricorder over the material. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/06/93 - ACT TWO 21. O\\'Brien looks unhappy with the results of his scan. He resets the tricorder and tries again, but still looks unsatisfied. O\\'BRIEN Whatever it was, it\\'s been pretty well cooked by this conduit. O\\'Brien puts away the tricorder and takes out a new tool. O\\'BRIEN Let\\'s take a sample to Doctor Bashir, see what he makes of it. 19 EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL) Re-establishing. 20 INT. PROMENADE The next morning. O\\'Brien and Keiko walk together. We pick them up in mid-conversation moving to the Kiosk... O\\'BRIEN (troubled, unsatisfied) Ensign Aquino made a log entry the night he disappeared about some sort of plasma flow irregularity in the conduit... he indicated he was going to fix it... KEIKO Then, it was an accident... O\\'BRIEN I guess. Bashir confirmed the remains were human... I\\'m sure the DNA trace will show it\\'s Aquino... As they reach the Kiosk... O\\'BRIEN (to the vendor) I\\'ll take one. (looks at Keiko) Unless you\\'re feeling adventurous today. VENDOR Sorry, we\\'re all out. O\\'Brien sees a half dozen Jumja sticks on the back shelf. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/05/93 - ACT TWO 22. 20 CONTINUED: O\\'BRIEN What are you talking about... I can see them with my own eyes. The Vendor doesn\\'t even look... stares at Keiko with hostility... VENDOR These aren\\'t for sale... O\\'Brien looks at him looking at Keiko who turns away, hurt... O\\'Brien loses it... O\\'BRIEN Not for sale, huh... He reaches across and grabs the guy\\'s collar and pulls him halfway out of the Kiosk... passersby react, ODO is nearby, sees and starts moving over... O\\'BRIEN How would you like a jumja stick... KEIKO Miles... ODO Is there a problem? O\\'BRIEN You\\'re damned right... VENDOR I don\\'t have to sell anything to them if I don\\'t want to. ODO (honestly confused) Why wouldn\\'t you want to sell to them? KEIKO (hurt and uncomfortable) Miles, can we go... O\\'Brien doesn\\'t want to leave it, but sees the pain his wife is in... drops it... O\\'BRIEN Forget it... They walk away... Odo exchanges a glance with the Vendor... who spits the words out at Keiko\\'s back -- DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/05/93 - ACT TWO 23. 20 CONTINUED: (2) VENDOR Seek the prophets. Odo reacts and exchanges a look with the Vendor, walks away, murmuring out of earshot... ODO Seek them yourself. 21 ANGLE - ON O\\'BRIEN AND KEIKO O\\'BRIEN (looking back at the Kiosk) Maybe you were right... we\\'ve got no business here... I\\'ll just put in for a transfer and that\\'ll be... KEIKO No... I can\\'t run away from this now... (beat, looking ahead) What\\'s this... 22 NEW ANGLE - A GROUP OF BAJORANS waiting outside the entrance to the classroom. The group is composed of ten Bajoran parents and the children (including Jake) plus Vedek Winn, a monk from her order, and eight or so Bajoran civilians. WINN (to the parents) If we abandon the Prophets, then everything we have will be... As parents look over her shoulder and react to Keiko\\'s arrival, she stops in mid-sentence, turns, smiles... WINN Here\\'s Mrs. O\\'Brien now. KEIKO (without a smile) Good morning. WINN Are you Mister O\\'Brien? O\\'BRIEN That\\'s right. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/05/93 - ACT TWO 24. 22 CONTINUED: WINN A pleasure to meet you. I\\'ve been listening to many wonderful things about your wife from the parents of these children. She\\'s apparently an excellent teacher. O\\'BRIEN She doesn\\'t deserve what you\\'re doing to her. WINN (taken in stride) I feel your anger toward me... I accept it and forgive you for it. (to Keiko) Mrs. O\\'Brien, if I\\'ve misjudged you, I am terribly sorry. Have I? Is there a place in your school for the prophets? A long beat as they lock eyes. A cutaway of Jake studying this interchange with concern. The parents want desperately for her to say yes. KEIKO (softly but firm) No. The onlookers murmur with hostility... but Winn never joins that sentiment... WINN I admire you for standing by your convictions. Even though I disagree with them. Please believe me, I want to find a way to allow these children to stay in your school... KEIKO I\\'m sure the children and their parents are happy to hear you say that. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/05/93 - ACT TWO 25. 22 CONTINUED: (2) WINN Let me be the one to make the first concession. I will no longer request that you teach anything about the celestial temple. A beat. More murmers of surprise... Keiko glances at O\\'Brien. WINN Just don\\'t teach anything about the wormhole at all. KEIKO (reacts) Ignore it... ? WINN Find other things to teach the children. KEIKO And when we get to theories of evolution or the creation of the universe, what then... WINN We\\'ll face those issues when we come to them. KEIKO I\\'m a teacher. My responsibility is to expose my students to knowledge. Not hide it from them. The answer is no. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/05/93 - ACT TWO 26. 22 CONTINUED: (3) Winn looks at the parents, shakes her head, sadly. WINN (beat) I\\'ve tried to be reasonable. She puts her arm around a Bajoran child and ushers her away... the others and the parents all follow... we take a moment to see Jake, who\\'s standing there with a handful of other students (three humans and an alien), now looking terribly concerned about all this... and finally, Keiko watches them go in pain... as O\\'Brien puts his arm around her and comforts her... FADE OUT. END OF ACT TWO DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/05/93 - ACT THREE 27. ACT THREE FADE IN: 23 INT. OPS Sisko, Kira, O\\'Brien, Odo, and Dax in conference around the Ops table. SISKO If Aquino turned off the conduit to fix the relay... why did it reactivate. O\\'BRIEN The Cardassians only equipped those power conduits with one flow regulator per level. The computer could\\'ve realigned it. When the power flow was rerouted back, it could\\'ve caught him inside. DAX You don\\'t sound entirely convinced. O\\'BRIEN No, it all adds up only... I don\\'t know... SISKO Spit it out, Chief. O\\'BRIEN (laughs sadly, it seems ridiculous in context) He borrowed one of my tools without asking. KIRA It was four in the morning. Maybe he didn\\'t want to bother you. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/05/93 - ACT THREE 28. 23 CONTINUED: O\\'BRIEN The repairs could\\'ve waited til the next day. (beat) He was a Starfleet engineer... you don\\'t take the Chief\\'s tools without asking... it\\'s unheard of... ODO Are you suggesting it might not have been an accident? O\\'BRIEN I don\\'t know what I\\'m suggesting. I only know what I know. He should\\'ve asked. Odo\\'s mind begins to work... in the background, Jake arrives on the Turbolift... SISKO Constable, maybe you ought to take a closer look into this... Odo acknowledges and EXITS... Sisko looks over to see Jake moving to him... surprised to see him here... SISKO Dismissed. (rising, to Jake) Hi. JAKE Can I talk to you for a minute. SISKO Sure. Moving into the Commander\\'s office. SISKO (continuing) I heard what happened at school. 24 INT. COMMANDER\\'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS SISKO (continuing) Did Mrs. O\\'Brien call off classes? DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/05/93 - ACT THREE 29. 24 CONTINUED: JAKE No. There was only me and four other kids left, but she still kept the school open. They sit away from the desk.JAKE (CONTINUING) She changed the lesson to teach us about Galileo. Did you know he was tried by the Inquisition for teaching that the earth moved around the sun? SISKO Tried and convicted. His books were burned. JAKE How could anyone be so stupid? SISKO It\\'s easy to look back seven centuries and judge what was right and wrong. JAKE But the same thing is happening now! All this stuff about a celestial temple in the wormhole is dumb. Sisko studies him for a beat... SISKO No, it\\'s not. You\\'ve got to understand something, Jake. For over fifty years, the one thing that allowed Bajorans to survive the Cardassian occupation was their faith. The prophets were their only source of hope and courage. JAKE But they weren\\'t prophets. They were just some aliens that you found in the wormhole. SISKO To those aliens, the future is no more difficult to see than the past. So why shouldn\\'t they be considered prophets? DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/05/93 - ACT THREE 30. 24 CONTINUED: (2) JAKE Are you serious? SISKO My point is it\\'s a matter of interpretation. It may not be what you believe, but that doesn\\'t make it wrong. If you start to think that way, you\\'ll be acting just like Vedek Winn. Only from the other side. (beat) We can\\'t afford to think that way, Jake. We\\'d lose everything we\\'ve worked for here... Jake begins to understand... JAKE (beat, studying his dad) You\\'re worried, aren\\'t you... Sisko nods silently. JAKE What\\'re you gonna do? SISKO I\\'m not sure. But I think I\\'ve got to find some help. 25 EXT. BAJORAN CAPITAL - DAY (MATTE) (STOCK) Establishing shot of the Bajoran Capital. 26 EXT. MONASTERY OF THE KAI - WOODED GARDEN - DAY Sisko wanders through a quiet garden inside the walls of the Kai Temple complex. VEDEK BAREIL, a short Bajoran man about fifty-five in religious garb, ENTERS the garden and approaches Sisko. Bareil is a soft-spoken and gentle man, somewhat reminiscent of Gandhi or the Dalai Lama. BAREIL I\\'m sorry for keeping you waiting, Commander Sisko. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/08/93 - ACT THREE 31. 26 CONTINUED: SISKO Vedek Bareil... ? The open face of the spiritual man acknowledges, looks into the eyes of Sisko who smiles... Sisko bows his head and turns it to the side so the Vedek can reach his ear... BAREIL Please. There is no need to pay tribute to me, Commander... SISKO (awkward) Pay tribute... ? No, I was just... (beat) Usually, when I meet one of Bajor\\'s spiritual leaders, the first thing they do is grab my... BAREIL ... Ear? Sisko acknowledges... Bareil laughs warmly... BAREIL Unpleasant, isn\\'t it. SISKO I\\'ve been far too polite to admit it. BAREIL I was five the first time one of the monks grabbed my ear... he was a stern old crow who could virtually squeeze the pagh right out of you with his thumb and forefinger... and as a chronic misbehaver, I was his favorite victim. I swore that one of my life\\'s goals would be to do away with that archaic ritual. SISKO (feeling comfortable with this man, smiles, not too serious) You can count on the Federation\\'s support. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/12/93 - ACT THREE 32. 26 CONTINUED: (2) BAREIL (leading the way) I hope you don\\'t mind if I get a little planting done while we talk... All the hours listening to a hundred and twelve Vedeks talking at once makes me yearn again for the sanctity of my arboretum... They walk... SISKO Is this yours? BAREIL (acknowledges) I started my service at the monastery as the gardener, Commander. I had no ambitions other than to grow the most lovely Feloran bromiliads on the planet. But the prophets did not allow me that peaceful life. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/05/93 - ACT THREE 33. 27 NEW ANGLE as they change paths... BAREIL (continuing) I understand my friend Vedek Winn has brought her blessings to your station. SISKO I was hoping you might be able to arrange an audience with the assembly so I could discuss our school. BAREIL Why me? SISKO You are the leading candidate to be the next Kai. And, if I\\'ve been correctly informed, your ideology is quite different than Vedek Winn\\'s. BAREIL You have been correctly informed. He pauses. BAREIL I\\'m sorry. But the Vedek Assembly will not see you, Commander. SISKO Why not? BAREIL Some fear you as the symbol of a Federation they view as godless. Some fear you as the Emissary who has walked with the prophets. Some fear you because Vedek Winn told them to.

If the prophets will it, someday, I may be Kai. And I can be a better friend to you then. SISKO In other words, being my friend now might hurt your chances. BAREIL The prophets teach us patience. SISKO It appears they also teach you politics. That\\'s almost an accusation... but Bareil dismisses it... BAREIL I\\'m sorry you\\'ve made the long trip for nothing. Please stay and enjoy the gardens as long as you like. He moves away. On Sisko\\'s expression. 28 EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL) Re-establishing. 29 INT. OPS Sisko ENTERS from the Turbolift. Kira, Dax and O\\'Brien are at their stations. Neela is helping O\\'Brien, but there are no other Bajorans in Ops. Sisko notices. SISKO Is it my imagination or are we a little short handed today? KIRA Three Bajoran crewmen didn\\'t report for duty. (beat, obviously untrue) They... said they weren\\'t feeling well. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/05/93 - ACT THREE 35. 29 CONTINUED: Sisko understands that this is not a coincidence. SISKO Do you think it\\'s contagious, Major? KIRA It\\'s too early to tell. Sisko is feeling this whole relationship between the Federation and Bajor slipping away... and the frustration is getting to him. He is quiet but sharp with Kira here... but not loud enough to draw O\\'Brien and Neela\\'s attention away from what they\\'re doing... SISKO Are your people willing to throw away everything we\\'ve accomplished during the past seven months? KIRA (would never go that far) Everyone knows that if the Federation leaves the Cardassians will be back... SISKO With all due respect, Major, protecting your borders is not the primary reason the Federation is here and it\\'s not why I\\'m here. I\\'m here to build a trusting relationship with your people... and I\\'d like to start feeling that somebody... (unstated: like you) ... somebody on your side is giving something back to this effort. KIRA I think I\\'ve given you all the support I can, short of... And this is too loud, for the first time getting O\\'Brien and Neela\\'s attention -- SISKO (interrupting) It\\'s not enough. A beat. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/06/93 - ACT THREE 36. 29 CONTINUED: (2) KIRA (hurt, quiet) I thought there was room on this station for all philosophies. Sisko\\'s gone too far and he knows it but is unable to admit that here... he\\'s just too angry... quietly -- SISKO You tell our sick Bajoran crewmen that they better get well immediately or they\\'ll recover on the way to their next assignment. KIRA Yes. Sir. During the above, Odo and BASHIR arrive on the Turbolift... she EXITS as they move to Sisko... ODO Commander, Doctor Bashir has found some new evidence about Ensign Aquino you should see... And Sisko reacts, this is by comparison a nuisance, drawing his attention away from where it ought to be... Bashir hands Sisko a PADD... O\\'Brien moves over to check this out... Sisko examines the PADD with no understanding... BASHIR I\\'ve finally managed to reconstruct the victim\\'s DNA. It\\'s definitely Aquino. But the power flow in the conduit didn\\'t kill him. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/08/93 - ACT THREE 37. 29 CONTINUED: (3) BASHIR (re: the PADD) You see, the plasma disruption in his cellular membranes indicates he was exposed to a directed energy discharge before he was placed in the conduit. O\\'BRIEN A directed energy discharge. From a phaser? ODO (acknowledges) Set to kill. Off reactions... FADE OUT. END OF ACT THREE DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/06/93 - ACT FOUR 38.

If we see into Ops, we will notice that the Bajoran Crewmembers are back at work. SISKO Could this murder be related in any way to the tensions over the school issue? KIRA (defensive) If you\\'re suggesting he was killed by a Bajoran just because he was from the Federation... BASHIR (shortcutting) The analysis proves he was killed the night before Vedek Winn arrived. There wasn\\'t any school issue yet. Kira looks satisfied. SISKO Any ideas about a motive? Silence. SISKO All right then, let\\'s start from the beginning. Ensign Aquino goes to make a repair to a power conduit... ODO One moment Commander, I\\'m not convinced of that... KIRA But the log... ODO It might have been altered by our killer to cover his tracks. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/06/93 - ACT FOUR 39. 31 CONTINUED: ODO I checked the Turbolift records the night of the murder. Aquino did take a Turbolift to level three but not to the power conduit where he was found... DAX Where did he go? ODO Runabout Pad \"C\"... O\\'BRIEN A runabout... ? What was he doing at a runabout at four in the morning? ODO Apparently, he was getting murdered. Off reactions... 32 INT. RUNABOUT AIRLOCK Neela works inside an open access panel on the side of the airlock corridor. O\\'Brien emerges from the runabout. O\\'BRIEN Everything in the runabout seems perfectly normal. NEELA It doesn\\'t look like the airlock systems have been tampered with. O\\'BRIEN (beat) Let\\'s run a level one diagnostic of the runabout\\'s computer interface, then we\\'ll call it a day. NEELA I already have. Everything\\'s normal. They sit on the floor by the open panel... letting go for a moment... DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/06/93 - ACT FOUR 40. 32 CONTINUED: O\\'BRIEN Hell, I don\\'t even know what we\\'re looking for. If anything happened here, it\\'s been pretty well covered up. Neela nods, frustrated, a quick brief shudder passes across her shoulders... softly vulnerable, and sad -- NEELA Did you know him well? O\\'BRIEN Aquino? Barely knew him at all. Just the welcome aboard, if you need anything speech. You? NEELA Not really. Bajoran and Starfleet officers don\\'t socialize too much... O\\'BRIEN How come? NEELA I don\\'t know. I guess we just keep to ourselves. O\\'BRIEN You\\'re not like that with me. NEELA (smiles) You\\'re not like the others. (off O\\'Brien\\'s curious reaction) You know. You don\\'t put on any airs... You\\'re just... nicer. She smiles warmly at him. A beat. And suddenly it\\'s just a little too intimate for O\\'Brien\\'s comfort... he gets up. O\\'BRIEN Well, uh, look, I\\'ll close up here... why don\\'t you take off... NEELA You sure? O\\'BRIEN (double meaning) Yeah. I\\'m sure. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/06/93 - ACT FOUR 41. 32 CONTINUED: (2) NEELA (smiles) Good night. She picks up her tool kit and EXITS, O\\'Brien watches her go a beat, starts to finish up his work... O\\'BRIEN (murmuring to himself) On your toes, O\\'Brien. A beat. His mind comes back to the investigation, taps his finger on the console... a new thought -- O\\'BRIEN Computer, expand diagnostic to include linkups to Runabout Pads A and B. COMPUTER VOICE Diagnostic initiated. Function will require three minutes forty seconds. O\\'Brien goes back to finishing up the work... 33 INT. PROMENADE Odo is observing the arrival through the airlock of many Bajorans... most of them dressed in traditional (Storyteller) garb... QUARK moves up beside him... QUARK You were looking for me? Odo grunts an acknowledgement, but is watching the faces of the arriving Bajorans... like a camera clicking them off for later reference... Quark follows his attention... QUARK Don\\'t tell me... there\\'s a Bajoran convention on the station that I didn\\'t know about... thanks, Odo, I need to call in more dabo girls... DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/06/93 - ACT FOUR 42-42A. 33 CONTINUED: ODO It\\'s not a convention. They\\'re from an orthodox spiritual order coming to support Vedek Winn\\'s efforts to keep the Bajoran children out of school... QUARK Orthodox. In that case, I\\'ll need twice as many dabo girls. These spiritual types love those dabo girls. Odo moves away from the airlock... they move slowly down the Promenade together... ODO This is not what I wanted to talk to you about. What do you know about the murder of Ensign Aquino? QUARK (reacts) You wound me. All the years together. I thought you knew me. Odo, I am not a killer. ODO No. But most of your friends are. QUARK True. And I would gladly sell one of them to you if I could. But unfortunately, none of them have taken credit for the death of the Starfleet officer. Sorry. In the background, O\\'Brien arrives, moving with a purpose, sees Odo, moves toward him... O\\'BRIEN Odo... Odo sees him coming, stops, getting rid of Quark -- ODO Keep your ears open. QUARK Are you kidding? That\\'s the seventh rule of acquisition. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/08/93 - ACT FOUR 43. 33 CONTINUED: (2) Quark acknowledges O\\'Brien, leaves... O\\'Brien hands Odo a small electronic component... O\\'BRIEN It\\'s a security bypass module. ODO You found this at Runabout Pad \"C\"? O\\'BRIEN No, that\\'s just it... it wasn\\'t at Pad \"C\"... that was clean as a whistle... just to be safe, I ran a diagnostic across the board and this showed up at pad \"A\"... ODO Pad \"A\"... ? O\\'BRIEN Aquino never went near Runabout \"A\"... Doesn\\'t make sense. ODO On the contrary, it makes perfect sense. Ensign Aquino goes to Runabout \"C\" because some sensor shows an anomaly in the security net there... he interrupts whoever is tampering with it and is killed. The killer puts the body in the conduit and instead of going back to pad \"C,\" which might be traced with Aquino\\'s Turbolift log, he changes his plan and moves to pad \"A.\" O\\'BRIEN But what was the plan? Everything else seems normal. ODO I\\'d guess somebody wanted to steal a runabout. O\\'BRIEN We\\'re not missing any. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/06/93 - ACT FOUR 44. 33 CONTINUED: (3) ODO Curious. They went to a lot of trouble to defeat the security net and then didn\\'t go through... Odo is interrupted by the SOUND of a HUGE EXPLOSION. People all over the Promenade are staggered by the blast. O\\'Brien immediately realizes... O\\'BRIEN The school. He bolts in that direction... Odo right behind him... 34 INT. PROMENADE - OUTSIDE KEIKO\\'S SCHOOL Odo and O\\'Brien round a curve in the Promenade to find Keiko\\'s school fully engulfed in flames. O\\'Brien tries to rush inside the school, but Odo grabs him. O\\'BRIEN Keiko... Fire BLASTS out of the schoolroom as it is rocked by a secondary explosion. 35 ANGLE ON O\\'BRIEN As the light from the flames flickers on his face. A beat later, Keiko runs around the bend and he sees her, and his eyes fill with tears of relief... as she reacts with shock... he moves to her, holds onto her for dear life... and as their embrace is framed by the fire... FADE OUT. END OF ACT FOUR DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/06/93 - ACT FIVE 45. ACT FIVE FADE IN: 36 INT. PROMENADE - OUTSIDE THE SCHOOLROOM A crowd has gathered to see the smoldering wreckage. Kira and Neela are examining the rubble. They are joined by Sisko and Odo. In the background, Odo\\'s two deputies control the crowd. O\\'Brien and Keiko are no longer there. SISKO What\\'ve you got? KIRA (consulting tricorder) I\\'m reading traces of cabrodine and infernite, common explosives, both easily obtained. ODO Then we\\'re looking at a simple, homemade bomb. Sisko nods his agreement, but is distracted by the wallah of the crowd. Looks to see -- 37 ANGLE - VEDEK WINN Approaching through the crowd... accompanied by her monk assistant... moves to Sisko, she looks very upset... WINN Where is Mrs. O\\'Brien? SISKO Her husband took her home. WINN Was she hurt? Was anyone hurt? SISKO No. WINN (relieved) The prophets have been kind today. SISKO (containing his anger) The prophets... had nothing to do with what happened here today. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/06/93 - ACT FIVE 46. 37 CONTINUED: SISKO (Cont\\'d) This was the work of a disturbed and violent mind... who listened to your voice... not to the prophets. WINN (with an edge) Is the Emissary holding me responsible for this act of terrorism? SISKO The commander of this station is. WINN May the prophets forgive you for abandoning them. She begins to move away... Sisko won\\'t let her get away so easily... louder, getting the attention of others... SISKO You claim the prophets as your personal constituency, Vedek Winn. I\\'m not convinced that\\'s justified. Who do you speak for? An order that is barely listened to in your assembly... so you come here looking for a more receptive audience. And now she turns, declaring war, cold as ice... WINN Is that what your friend, Vedek Bareil told you? He\\'s as misguided as you are. (beat) No, that\\'s not fair... you are not simply misguided... as I once thought. Now I see that you want nothing less than to destroy us. Sisko gives her more rope... DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/06/93 - ACT FIVE 47. 37 CONTINUED: (2) SISKO Destroy you... WINN You live without a soul, Commander. You and your Federation exist in a universe of darkness and you would drag us in there with you. But we... will... not... go. Sisko studies her, and finally relaxes, grins. SISKO You\\'ve just made your first mistake, Vedek. WINN Have I. SISKO The Bajoran people who have lived with us on this station... who have worked with us for months... who helped us move this station to protect the wormhole... who have joined us to explore the Gamma Quadrant... who have begun to build the future of Bajor with us... these people know that we are neither your enemy nor... the devil. His eyes find -- 38 ANGLE - INCLUDE KIRA as his words reach her. SISKO (continuing) We don\\'t always agree. We have some damn good fights in fact. But we always come away from them with a little more understanding and appreciation for each other. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/06/93 - ACT FIVE 48. 39 BACK TO WINN AND SISKO SISKO (continuing) You won\\'t succeed here. This school will reopen. When your rhetoric gets old, the Bajoran parents will bring their children back. WINN We\\'ll see. Sisko nods and EXITS through the crowd... stay a beat on Winn as she considers this... several of the orthodox move to the Vedek to express their support in walla... VOICES (WALLA) You\\'re right, Vedek... they\\'re godless... we should drive them out of there... this isn\\'t your fault... he had no right to say that... he will pay in eternity for his blasphemy... She doesn\\'t care about any of them, works her way through the crowd until by chance she makes eye contact with -- 40 ANGLE ON NEELA who looks at her. 41 WINN nods with recognition. 42 NEELA almost imperceptibly, acknowledges the nod. 43 INT. OPS Sisko ENTERS on the Turbolift... Dax and O\\'Brien are at their stations... he\\'s burying his fury in his work, working on his sensors... SISKO How is she, Chief? DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/08/93 - ACT FIVE 49. 43 CONTINUED: O\\'BRIEN Pretty shaken up, but she\\'s planning to hold classes tomorrow in one of the small cargo bays if that\\'s okay. SISKO (smiles) You tell her Jake\\'ll be there on time. O\\'BRIEN That\\'ll make her feel a lot better, sir. In the background, Kira, Neela and a Federation crewman arrive... SISKO Anything new on Aquino? O\\'BRIEN Yessir. I found a security bypass module at Runabout Pad \"A\"... looks like someone might have wanted to steal a runabout. That\\'s probably why Aquino went there in the first place... 44 ANGLE - NEELA who has arrived at the engineering station reacts as she hears this... O\\'BRIEN I\\'ve put security seals in place at all three pads... and I\\'m checking for any other anomalies down there... Sisko acknowledges... DAX Benjamin, incoming transmission from Vedek Bareil aboard a Bajoran transport... SISKO On screen...

BAREIL Commander, I\\'ve decided to accept your gracious invitation. SISKO Invitation? BAREIL (poker-faced) You did invite me to tour your facility... ? SISKO Yes, yes, of course, Vedek. We\\'d be honored. Unfortunately, we have some damage on our Promenade we won\\'t have time to clean up before you arrive. BAREIL Yes. I heard about it. (pointed) Perhaps I can help you clean it up. SISKO That would be very much appreciated. BAREIL It\\'s the least a friend can do. I look forward to seeing you again. The transmission ends. On Sisko\\'s delighted reaction... 46 INT. BAJORAN SHRINE Neela ENTERS the Bajoran Shrine, where Vedek Winn is talking quietly to her monk. Winn notices Neela... sends the other monk away. WINN (gently) My dear, you should not be here. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/06/93 - ACT FIVE 50A. 46 CONTINUED: NEELA (worried) Vedek, they found out about the runabout. WINN I see.

NEELA But if I go through with it now, I\\'ll be caught and executed. Winn takes her hands and looks deeply into her eyes... WINN Sometimes the sacrifices the prophets call on us to make are great, my child. But the rewards they give will last through eternity. Neela nods her understanding. 47 EXT.

Sisko arrives, exhausted, on the Turbolift, reacts as he sees Kira sitting alone at her station at the table... staring ahead in thought... trying to make some sense out of all this... He moves beside her, lays a hand on her shoulder which breaks her trance. She looks up at him and he sits beside her. It\\'s a gentle, subdued moment between them. SISKO Neela insists she acted alone. Unless you want to consider the prophets co- conspirators. KIRA She\\'ll never tell us the truth. We\\'ll never be able to prove Winn was involved. SISKO (beat, studying her) You okay? KIRA (sighs) Okay... ? I\\'ve forgotten \"okay.\" Haven\\'t seen \"okay\" in what seems like years. (beat) I\\'ve been sitting here thinking. Last year at this time, I was fighting the Cardassians in some nameless swamp. If you\\'d\\'ve stopped by and told me in just one year, they\\'d be gone, and I\\'d be wearing a uniform, up here in charge of protecting some wormhole... SISKO ... protecting your celestial temple... KIRA (beat) I envied Vedek Winn because she was a true believer... I wanted my faith to be as strong as hers. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/06/93 - ACT FIVE 64. 78 CONTINUED: SISKO Maybe it is. Kira thinks that over. Sisko rises. SISKO I have a report to put together for Starfleet... you ought to get some rest... KIRA I\\'d rather help you... He nods, okay, come on... she rises... KIRA Commander... (beat) I heard what you said to Vedek Winn at the school. I just wanted you to know... you were right about the Bajorans here, about me at least... I don\\'t think you\\'re... (beat, using his words) ... \"the devil.\" He smiles warmly. SISKO Then I guess we\\'ve made some progress after all. She smiles back. He puts his arm around her shoulder and as they move into his office... 79 thru OMITTED 80 FADE OUT. END OF ACT FIVE THE END'"

Moving with the glop to reveal O\\'BRIEN who takes it... O\\'BRIEN You sure? KEIKO (makes a face) It\\'s so sweet. O\\'BRIEN It\\'s a natural sweetness from the sap of the jumja tree... filled with vitamin C. He takes a lick. They move away from the Kiosk. KEIKO Since when did you become such an expert on jumja sticks? O\\'BRIEN Hmm? Oh, Neela told me. The name Neela gets a subtle response from Keiko. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/05/93 - TEASER 2. 1 CONTINUED: KEIKO Did she... ? (beat) So. Is she working out any better than the last one? O\\'BRIEN Neela? She\\'s terrific. She\\'s even taught me a few things. KEIKO (very dry) I\\'m glad to hear her expertise doesn\\'t end with jumja sticks... O\\'BRIEN (slow on the uptake) Oh yeah, she\\'s a good engin... (now he realizes) hold on... KEIKO What? O\\'BRIEN You\\'re not thinking... She keeps walking, poker faced... O\\'BRIEN Keiko... She smiles, satisfied, secure in her marriage... KEIKO (teasing) Just keeping you on your toes, O\\'Brien. O\\'BRIEN Very funny, O\\'Brien. KEIKO (flirtatious) Be careful who you share your jumja with... Smiles sexily and walks away... off O\\'Brien\\'s reaction... DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - 04/02/93 - TEASER 3. 2 EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL) The wormhole illuminates in the background as a ship goes through. KEIKO (V.O.) Now, as we discussed in yesterday\\'s lesson, the wormhole was discovered by Commander Sisko and Lieutenant Dax earlier this year. After a beat, PULL BACK TO REVEAL... that in fact, we\\'re in... 2A OMITTED 3 INT. SCHOOLROOM - KEIKO (OPTICAL) is standing in front of a large monitor/blackboard with the wormhole displayed. As usual, most of Keiko\\'s students are Bajoran, with a handful of humans and other aliens. JAKE is present, but Nog is not. As she moves away from the monitor... KEIKO (continuing) Does anyone know what makes this wormhole so unusual? Jake raises his hand... KEIKO Jake? JAKE It\\'s stable... ? 4 NEW ANGLE As Keiko speaks, a Bajoran woman ENTERS the schoolroom. The woman, VEDEK WINN, is dressed in religious garb similar to, but easily distinguishable from, the clothing worn by the monks on the station. In attitude and bearing, Winn comes across like your favorite aunt: helpful, sympathetic, and caring. The Vedek stands quietly at the back of the class like a principal observing... DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - 04/02/93 - TEASER 3A. 4 CONTINUED: KEIKO (continuing) It\\'s stable, that\\'s right, Jake... it\\'s the first stable wormhole known to exist... Keiko notices the Vedek... smiles an acknowledgement, as she continues the lesson, curious about her... the Vedek nods hello... DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/08/93 - TEASER 4. 4 CONTINUED: (2) WINN (smiles, I don\\'t wish to interrupt) Please... continue... KEIKO (nods) A stable wormhole is very important because it allows us to travel secure in the knowledge that neither end will shift location. Who knows why the wormhole is stable... ? The students seem disconcerted by the presence of a stranger... no one raises their hand... KEIKO Because it was artificially constructed. Commander Sisko encountered the entities who created the wormhole when he... WINN Excuse me, by the \"entities,\" do you not mean \"the prophets\"... ? KEIKO (beat, senses the issue) Yes... on Bajor... the entities are worshipped as prophets. (beat, moving quickly on) Our studies of the wormhole have shown that it was formed by unique particles we call verterons that are apparently self-sustaining... this begins to explain how a ship at impulse can safely pass through... WINN Ships are safely guided through the passage by the hands of the prophets. KEIKO (beat) In a manner of speaking... DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/05/93 - TEASER 5. 4 CONTINUED: (3) WINN (deceptively sweet) Not apparently your manner of speaking... This has gone too far in front of the children... KEIKO Perhaps we should discuss this after... WINN Do you believe the celestial temple of the prophets exists within the passage... ? KEIKO I respect that the Bajoran people believe it does. WINN But that\\'s not what you teach. Keiko understands now that there is to be no avoiding this. Firm, confident, but not aggressively and without hostility -- KEIKO No, I don\\'t teach Bajoran spiritual beliefs. That\\'s your job. Mine is to open the children\\'s minds... to history... to literature... to mathematics... to science... Winn sounds sad. Like she is deeply hurt by what she is being forced to say. WINN (very apologetic) You are opening the children\\'s minds... to blasphemy. And I cannot permit it to continue. Her strong eyes study... DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - 04/02/93 - TEASER 6. 5 KEIKO We hold on Keiko\\'s troubled expression for a moment, then we... FADE OUT. END OF TEASER DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/05/93 - ACT ONE 7. ACT ONE FADE IN: (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) 6 INT. SECURITY OFFICE (VPB) NEELA, O\\'Brien\\'s Bajoran apprentice, works on something inside an open panel under the security monitors (which are blank). Neela is in her early twenties, bright, pretty, and eager to please. O\\'Brien ENTERS, carrying his tool case. O\\'BRIEN Sorry I couldn\\'t get here sooner. Another fusion reactor went down. How\\'s it going? Neela keeps working, she tweaks a few things, and then... NEELA Done. O\\'BRIEN (pleasantly surprised) Done? (off her nod) Did you remember to re-initialize the isolinear co-processor? NEELA (nods again) I did it exactly like you showed me. Should I test it? O\\'BRIEN Let me. You know us old folks. We like to feel useful. O\\'Brien keys in some commands on Odo\\'s security desk and the wall monitors come back to life. O\\'BRIEN Not bad, not bad at all. (to Neela, kidding) If you keep this up, I\\'m going to be out of a job. NEELA (smiles) I doubt that. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - 04/02/93 - ACT ONE 8-8A. 6 CONTINUED: O\\'BRIEN Let\\'s close her up. 6A NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL) O\\'Brien and Neela place the panel back in place. Neela takes a small high tech tool and plays it over the edge of the panel. O\\'BRIEN (re: the tool) Not that one... this is a security seal. You need an E-J-Seven Interlock to open or close it. NEELA (confused) E-J-Seven? Neela looks at her tool kit. O\\'BRIEN (goes for his own tool box) Never mind... I\\'ve got one. 6B BACK TO SCENE O\\'Brien searches his tool box, but he can\\'t find what he\\'s looking for. He double-checks, but it\\'s not there. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/05/93 - ACT ONE 9. 6B CONTINUED: O\\'BRIEN Bloody hell. NEELA What\\'s wrong? O\\'BRIEN My E-J-Seven. It\\'s missing. NEELA Maybe you left it in Ops. O\\'BRIEN (beat, shakes his head) I don\\'t misplace my tools. On his concerned expression... 7 INT. COMMANDER\\'S OFFICE Keiko is talking to SISKO. He\\'s grim, concerned. SISKO I\\'m not exactly surprised. KEIKO You knew this was going to happen? SISKO A confrontation like this was inevitable. (rises) Sometimes, I wonder if we\\'ll ever find the common ground we need to bring Bajor into the Federation. Sisko opens the door to Ops... calls to Kira -- DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/05/93 - ACT ONE 10. 7 CONTINUED: SISKO Major, would you join us? Kira comes in... SISKO We\\'ve been talking about an incident this morning at the school... KIRA I heard... Vedek Winn has been meeting with some of the Bajoran civilians about it... Sisko frowns... SISKO What do you know about her? KIRA She\\'s from an orthodox order... she has some support to become the next Kai... but probably not enough... KEIKO The question is how much support does she have on this station? KIRA (casual) She has mine. Sisko reacts... KEIKO You can\\'t possibly believe teaching the facts about the wormhole amounts to blasphemy... KIRA (not hostile) I think some revisions in the school curriculum might be appropriate... you teach a lot of Bajoran children... DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/05/93 - ACT ONE 11. 7 CONTINUED: (2) KEIKO (confrontational) I\\'m not going to let a Bajoran spiritual leader dictate what can or can\\'t be taught in my classroom... Kira reacts, obviously she\\'s dealing with a closed mind here... looks to Sisko... KIRA (to Sisko) Then maybe we need two schools on this station... one for Bajoran children and another for the Federation... Sisko sighs, a beat... SISKO If we start separating Bajoran and Federation interests... KIRA A lot of Bajoran and Federation interests are separate, Commander... I\\'ve been telling you that all along. SISKO Nobody\\'s saying there can\\'t be spiritual teaching on this station, Major... but why can\\'t it be in addition to what\\'s taught in Mrs. O\\'Brien\\'s classroom... KIRA But if she\\'s teaching a fundamentally different philosophy... KEIKO I\\'m not teaching any philosophy... I\\'m trying to teach pure science... DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/05/93 - ACT ONE 12. 7 CONTINUED: (3) KIRA Some might say pure science, taught without a spiritual context, is a philosophy, Mrs. O\\'Brien... Keiko is very frustrated... SISKO My philosophy is that there is room for all philosophies on this station. (beat, to Kira) How do you suggest we deal with this? KIRA I\\'m not sure you can. The \"you\" is deliberate. There is no we yet. 7A thru OMITTED 7B 8 INT. PROMENADE Activity as usual... finding Sisko entering the Bajoran Shrine. A Bajoran monk, dressed in vestments similar to Winn\\'s, steps aside to let Sisko in. 9 INT. BAJORAN SHRINE An ornate candlelit interior. A string instrument (audio only) making soft, pulsating sounds adds to the mystical feeling. Vedek Winn is bowing her head before a shrine, cupping her ear in a ritual gesture with her eyes closed... as Sisko moves inside, reluctant to disturb her. Without opening her eyes to see him, she speaks... DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/05/93 - ACT ONE 13. 9 CONTINUED: WINN I can\\'t tell you how much I\\'ve looked forward to this moment. Now, she opens her eyes and turns to him... WINN I\\'m honored to meet the Emissary to the prophets. SISKO If you\\'d let me know you were coming, Vedek Winn, I would have greeted you sooner. WINN Pardon me, Emissary... I did not wish to bother you with my insignificant visit... SISKO I\\'d hardly call it insignificant. WINN (deliberately mistaken as a compliment) Thank you, Emissary. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/05/93 - ACT ONE 14. 9 CONTINUED: (2) SISKO I wish you wouldn\\'t call me that... I\\'m Commander Sisko... or Benjamin, if you\\'d like... WINN But you are the Emissary. Don\\'t you know the cherished place you\\'ve earned in the Bajoran spiritual life... ? SISKO I\\'m not sure I\\'m comfortable in that role. WINN The course the prophets choose for us may not always be comfortable. But we must follow it. Her hand reaches toward his ear... pauses... WINN May I? Sisko doesn\\'t stop her... she presses the ear as the Kai did in the pilot... they study each other for a long beat... nods... WINN Still the disbeliever. (beat) I once asked Kai Opaka why a disbeliever was destined to seek the prophets. She told me one should never look into the eyes of one\\'s own gods. (shakes her head) I disagreed. I told her I would do anything to look into their eyes. She suggested that I sit in darkness for a day and quite properly so. She cannot be replaced. I miss her deeply. SISKO (beat) It\\'s important to me that we resolve your problems with the school. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/05/93 - ACT ONE 15. 9 CONTINUED: (3) WINN The prophets have spoken to me through the orbs, Emissary. I understand my duty to defend the Bajoran faith. The teacher has dishonored the celestial temple. If she does not recant, I cannot be responsible for the consequences. Hold on Sisko\\'s reaction for a moment, then... 10 thru OMITTED 13 FADE OUT. END OF ACT ONE DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/05/93 - ACT TWO 16. ACT TWO FADE IN: 14 INT. OPS (VPB) O\\'Brien and Neela are at work at the Engineering station. We join them in mid-conversation. NEELA This still seems like an awful lot of trouble to go through to find one tool. O\\'BRIEN With that Interlock, someone could access every critical system on the station. As she acknowledges... DAX comes over... DAX Chief, have you seen Ensign Aquino recently? O\\'BRIEN (looks around Ops) No... now that you mention it. DAX He didn\\'t report for duty this morning. The computer says he\\'s not on the station, but he didn\\'t log out. O\\'BRIEN (worried) Have you talked to Odo? DAX I guess I\\'d better. She EXITS to the Turbolift... NEELA Scanners are ready. O\\'BRIEN Computer, show location of any independent tritanium sources... DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/08/93 - ACT TWO 17. 15 ANGLE - MONITOR (VPB) Looking at the monitor... NEELA Level three, section five... O\\'BRIEN That\\'s the tool locker... I\\'ve been through everything in there three times... O\\'Brien presses another panel... the image on the monitor changes... O\\'Brien reacts as he looks at the monitor... O\\'BRIEN Now what\\'s that? NEELA Looks like something in a power conduit on level twelve, section eight. O\\'BRIEN What would tritanium be doing in there? (thoughtful beat) Computer, shut down that conduit... reroute the power flow. COMPUTER Conduit deactivated. O\\'BRIEN (to Neela) Come on... They EXIT... 16 thru OMITTED 17 18 INT. POWER CONDUIT O\\'Brien uses a tricorder to scan the Jefferies tube-like power conduit. Behind him, Neela scans the other side. NEELA Over here, Chief. O\\'Brien joins Neela and examines a pile of slag on the floor of the conduit. He scans it with his tricorder. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/05/93 - ACT TWO 18-20. 18 CONTINUED: O\\'BRIEN It\\'s a tritanium composite, all right. Looks like our missing Interlock. NEELA It must have been melted by the conduit\\'s plasma flow. O\\'BRIEN (while continuing his scan) That still doesn\\'t explain how it got here in the first place. (notices something on his tricorder) Huh... Neela looks over his shoulder at the display. O\\'BRIEN (continuing) I\\'m picking up traces of organic material. Neela runs her own tricorder over the material. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/06/93 - ACT TWO 21. O\\'Brien looks unhappy with the results of his scan. He resets the tricorder and tries again, but still looks unsatisfied. O\\'BRIEN Whatever it was, it\\'s been pretty well cooked by this conduit. O\\'Brien puts away the tricorder and takes out a new tool. O\\'BRIEN Let\\'s take a sample to Doctor Bashir, see what he makes of it. 19 EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL) Re-establishing. 20 INT. PROMENADE The next morning. O\\'Brien and Keiko walk together. We pick them up in mid-conversation moving to the Kiosk... O\\'BRIEN (troubled, unsatisfied) Ensign Aquino made a log entry the night he disappeared about some sort of plasma flow irregularity in the conduit... he indicated he was going to fix it... KEIKO Then, it was an accident... O\\'BRIEN I guess. Bashir confirmed the remains were human... I\\'m sure the DNA trace will show it\\'s Aquino... As they reach the Kiosk... O\\'BRIEN (to the vendor) I\\'ll take one. (looks at Keiko) Unless you\\'re feeling adventurous today. VENDOR Sorry, we\\'re all out. O\\'Brien sees a half dozen Jumja sticks on the back shelf.

The Vendor doesn\\'t even look... stares at Keiko with hostility... VENDOR These aren\\'t for sale... O\\'Brien looks at him looking at Keiko who turns away, hurt... O\\'Brien loses it... O\\'BRIEN Not for sale, huh... He reaches across and grabs the guy\\'s collar and pulls him halfway out of the Kiosk... passersby react, ODO is nearby, sees and starts moving over... O\\'BRIEN How would you like a jumja stick... KEIKO Miles... ODO Is there a problem? O\\'BRIEN You\\'re damned right... VENDOR I don\\'t have to sell anything to them if I don\\'t want to. ODO (honestly confused) Why wouldn\\'t you want to sell to them? KEIKO (hurt and uncomfortable) Miles, can we go... O\\'Brien doesn\\'t want to leave it, but sees the pain his wife is in... drops it... O\\'BRIEN Forget it... They walk away... Odo exchanges a glance with the Vendor... who spits the words out at Keiko\\'s back -- DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/05/93 - ACT TWO 23. 20 CONTINUED: (2) VENDOR Seek the prophets. Odo reacts and exchanges a look with the Vendor, walks away, murmuring out of earshot... ODO Seek them yourself. 21 ANGLE - ON O\\'BRIEN AND KEIKO O\\'BRIEN (looking back at the Kiosk) Maybe you were right... we\\'ve got no business here... I\\'ll just put in for a transfer and that\\'ll be... KEIKO No... I can\\'t run away from this now... (beat, looking ahead) What\\'s this... 22 NEW ANGLE - A GROUP OF BAJORANS waiting outside the entrance to the classroom. The group is composed of ten Bajoran parents and the children (including Jake) plus Vedek Winn, a monk from her order, and eight or so Bajoran civilians. WINN (to the parents) If we abandon the Prophets, then everything we have will be... As parents look over her shoulder and react to Keiko\\'s arrival, she stops in mid-sentence, turns, smiles... WINN Here\\'s Mrs. O\\'Brien now. KEIKO (without a smile) Good morning. WINN Are you Mister O\\'Brien? O\\'BRIEN That\\'s right. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/05/93 - ACT TWO 24. 22 CONTINUED: WINN A pleasure to meet you. I\\'ve been listening to many wonderful things about your wife from the parents of these children. She\\'s apparently an excellent teacher. O\\'BRIEN She doesn\\'t deserve what you\\'re doing to her. WINN (taken in stride) I feel your anger toward me... I accept it and forgive you for it. (to Keiko) Mrs. O\\'Brien, if I\\'ve misjudged you, I am terribly sorry. Have I? Is there a place in your school for the prophets? A long beat as they lock eyes. A cutaway of Jake studying this interchange with concern. The parents want desperately for her to say yes. KEIKO (softly but firm) No. The onlookers murmur with hostility... but Winn never joins that sentiment... WINN I admire you for standing by your convictions. Even though I disagree with them. Please believe me, I want to find a way to allow these children to stay in your school... KEIKO I\\'m sure the children and their parents are happy to hear you say that. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/05/93 - ACT TWO 25. 22 CONTINUED: (2) WINN Let me be the one to make the first concession. I will no longer request that you teach anything about the celestial temple. A beat. More murmers of surprise... Keiko glances at O\\'Brien. WINN Just don\\'t teach anything about the wormhole at all. KEIKO (reacts) Ignore it... ? WINN Find other things to teach the children. KEIKO And when we get to theories of evolution or the creation of the universe, what then... WINN We\\'ll face those issues when we come to them. KEIKO I\\'m a teacher. My responsibility is to expose my students to knowledge. Not hide it from them. The answer is no. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/05/93 - ACT TWO 26. 22 CONTINUED: (3) Winn looks at the parents, shakes her head, sadly. WINN (beat) I\\'ve tried to be reasonable. She puts her arm around a Bajoran child and ushers her away... the others and the parents all follow... we take a moment to see Jake, who\\'s standing there with a handful of other students (three humans and an alien), now looking terribly concerned about all this... and finally, Keiko watches them go in pain... as O\\'Brien puts his arm around her and comforts her...

SISKO If Aquino turned off the conduit to fix the relay... why did it reactivate. O\\'BRIEN The Cardassians only equipped those power conduits with one flow regulator per level. The computer could\\'ve realigned it. When the power flow was rerouted back, it could\\'ve caught him inside. DAX You don\\'t sound entirely convinced. O\\'BRIEN No, it all adds up only... I don\\'t know... SISKO Spit it out, Chief. O\\'BRIEN (laughs sadly, it seems ridiculous in context) He borrowed one of my tools without asking. KIRA It was four in the morning. Maybe he didn\\'t want to bother you. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/05/93 - ACT THREE 28. 23 CONTINUED: O\\'BRIEN The repairs could\\'ve waited til the next day. (beat) He was a Starfleet engineer... you don\\'t take the Chief\\'s tools without asking... it\\'s unheard of... ODO Are you suggesting it might not have been an accident? O\\'BRIEN I don\\'t know what I\\'m suggesting. I only know what I know. He should\\'ve asked. Odo\\'s mind begins to work... in the background, Jake arrives on the Turbolift... SISKO Constable, maybe you ought to take a closer look into this... Odo acknowledges and EXITS... Sisko looks over to see Jake moving to him... surprised to see him here... SISKO Dismissed. (rising, to Jake) Hi. JAKE Can I talk to you for a minute. SISKO Sure. Moving into the Commander\\'s office. SISKO (continuing) I heard what happened at school. 24 INT. COMMANDER\\'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS SISKO (continuing) Did Mrs. O\\'Brien call off classes? DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/05/93 - ACT THREE 29. 24 CONTINUED: JAKE No. There was only me and four other kids left, but she still kept the school open. They sit away from the desk.JAKE (CONTINUING) She changed the lesson to teach us about Galileo. Did you know he was tried by the Inquisition for teaching that the earth moved around the sun? SISKO Tried and convicted. His books were burned. JAKE How could anyone be so stupid? SISKO It\\'s easy to look back seven centuries and judge what was right and wrong. JAKE But the same thing is happening now! All this stuff about a celestial temple in the wormhole is dumb. Sisko studies him for a beat... SISKO No, it\\'s not. You\\'ve got to understand something, Jake. For over fifty years, the one thing that allowed Bajorans to survive the Cardassian occupation was their faith. The prophets were their only source of hope and courage. JAKE But they weren\\'t prophets. They were just some aliens that you found in the wormhole. SISKO To those aliens, the future is no more difficult to see than the past. So why shouldn\\'t they be considered prophets? DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/05/93 - ACT THREE 30. 24 CONTINUED: (2) JAKE Are you serious? SISKO My point is it\\'s a matter of interpretation. It may not be what you believe, but that doesn\\'t make it wrong. If you start to think that way, you\\'ll be acting just like Vedek Winn. Only from the other side. (beat) We can\\'t afford to think that way, Jake. We\\'d lose everything we\\'ve worked for here... Jake begins to understand... JAKE (beat, studying his dad) You\\'re worried, aren\\'t you... Sisko nods silently. JAKE What\\'re you gonna do? SISKO I\\'m not sure. But I think I\\'ve got to find some help. 25 EXT. BAJORAN CAPITAL - DAY (MATTE) (STOCK) Establishing shot of the Bajoran Capital. 26 EXT. MONASTERY OF THE KAI - WOODED GARDEN - DAY Sisko wanders through a quiet garden inside the walls of the Kai Temple complex. VEDEK BAREIL, a short Bajoran man about fifty-five in religious garb, ENTERS the garden and approaches Sisko. Bareil is a soft-spoken and gentle man, somewhat reminiscent of Gandhi or the Dalai Lama. BAREIL I\\'m sorry for keeping you waiting, Commander Sisko. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/08/93 - ACT THREE 31. 26 CONTINUED: SISKO Vedek Bareil... ? The open face of the spiritual man acknowledges, looks into the eyes of Sisko who smiles... Sisko bows his head and turns it to the side so the Vedek can reach his ear... BAREIL Please. There is no need to pay tribute to me, Commander... SISKO (awkward) Pay tribute... ? No, I was just... (beat) Usually, when I meet one of Bajor\\'s spiritual leaders, the first thing they do is grab my... BAREIL ... Ear? Sisko acknowledges... Bareil laughs warmly... BAREIL Unpleasant, isn\\'t it. SISKO I\\'ve been far too polite to admit it. BAREIL I was five the first time one of the monks grabbed my ear... he was a stern old crow who could virtually squeeze the pagh right out of you with his thumb and forefinger... and as a chronic misbehaver, I was his favorite victim. I swore that one of my life\\'s goals would be to do away with that archaic ritual. SISKO (feeling comfortable with this man, smiles, not too serious) You can count on the Federation\\'s support. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/12/93 - ACT THREE 32. 26 CONTINUED: (2) BAREIL (leading the way) I hope you don\\'t mind if I get a little planting done while we talk... All the hours listening to a hundred and twelve Vedeks talking at once makes me yearn again for the sanctity of my arboretum... They walk... SISKO Is this yours? BAREIL (acknowledges) I started my service at the monastery as the gardener, Commander. I had no ambitions other than to grow the most lovely Feloran bromiliads on the planet. But the prophets did not allow me that peaceful life. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/05/93 - ACT THREE 33. 27 NEW ANGLE as they change paths... BAREIL (continuing) I understand my friend Vedek Winn has brought her blessings to your station. SISKO I was hoping you might be able to arrange an audience with the assembly so I could discuss our school. BAREIL Why me? SISKO You are the leading candidate to be the next Kai. And, if I\\'ve been correctly informed, your ideology is quite different than Vedek Winn\\'s. BAREIL You have been correctly informed. He pauses. BAREIL I\\'m sorry. But the Vedek Assembly will not see you, Commander. SISKO Why not? BAREIL Some fear you as the symbol of a Federation they view as godless. Some fear you as the Emissary who has walked with the prophets. Some fear you because Vedek Winn told them to. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/05/93 - ACT THREE 34. 27 CONTINUED: BAREIL We\\'re all very good conjuring up enough fear to justify whatever we want to do. Today, I am only a Vedek. If the prophets will it, someday, I may be Kai. And I can be a better friend to you then. SISKO In other words, being my friend now might hurt your chances. BAREIL The prophets teach us patience. SISKO It appears they also teach you politics. That\\'s almost an accusation... but Bareil dismisses it... BAREIL I\\'m sorry you\\'ve made the long trip for nothing. Please stay and enjoy the gardens as long as you like. He moves away. On Sisko\\'s expression. 28 EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL) Re-establishing. 29 INT. OPS Sisko ENTERS from the Turbolift. Kira, Dax and O\\'Brien are at their stations. Neela is helping O\\'Brien, but there are no other Bajorans in Ops. Sisko notices. SISKO Is it my imagination or are we a little short handed today? KIRA Three Bajoran crewmen didn\\'t report for duty. (beat, obviously untrue) They... said they weren\\'t feeling well. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/05/93 - ACT THREE 35. 29 CONTINUED: Sisko understands that this is not a coincidence. SISKO Do you think it\\'s contagious, Major? KIRA It\\'s too early to tell. Sisko is feeling this whole relationship between the Federation and Bajor slipping away... and the frustration is getting to him. He is quiet but sharp with Kira here... but not loud enough to draw O\\'Brien and Neela\\'s attention away from what they\\'re doing... SISKO Are your people willing to throw away everything we\\'ve accomplished during the past seven months? KIRA (would never go that far) Everyone knows that if the Federation leaves the Cardassians will be back... SISKO With all due respect, Major, protecting your borders is not the primary reason the Federation is here and it\\'s not why I\\'m here. I\\'m here to build a trusting relationship with your people... and I\\'d like to start feeling that somebody... (unstated: like you) ... somebody on your side is giving something back to this effort. KIRA I think I\\'ve given you all the support I can, short of... And this is too loud, for the first time getting O\\'Brien and Neela\\'s attention -- SISKO (interrupting) It\\'s not enough. A beat. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/06/93 - ACT THREE 36. 29 CONTINUED: (2) KIRA (hurt, quiet) I thought there was room on this station for all philosophies. Sisko\\'s gone too far and he knows it but is unable to admit that here... he\\'s just too angry... quietly -- SISKO You tell our sick Bajoran crewmen that they better get well immediately or they\\'ll recover on the way to their next assignment. KIRA Yes. Sir. During the above, Odo and BASHIR arrive on the Turbolift... she EXITS as they move to Sisko... ODO Commander, Doctor Bashir has found some new evidence about Ensign Aquino you should see... And Sisko reacts, this is by comparison a nuisance, drawing his attention away from where it ought to be... Bashir hands Sisko a PADD... O\\'Brien moves over to check this out... Sisko examines the PADD with no understanding... BASHIR I\\'ve finally managed to reconstruct the victim\\'s DNA. It\\'s definitely Aquino. But the power flow in the conduit didn\\'t kill him. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/08/93 - ACT THREE 37. 29 CONTINUED: (3) BASHIR (re: the PADD) You see, the plasma disruption in his cellular membranes indicates he was exposed to a directed energy discharge before he was placed in the conduit. O\\'BRIEN A directed energy discharge. From a phaser? ODO (acknowledges) Set to kill. Off reactions... FADE OUT. END OF ACT THREE DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/06/93 - ACT FOUR 38. ACT FOUR FADE IN: 30 EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL) 31 INT. COMMANDER\\'S OFFICE Sisko, Kira, Dax, Bashir, Odo and O\\'Brien are in conference in Sisko\\'s office. If we see into Ops, we will notice that the Bajoran Crewmembers are back at work. SISKO Could this murder be related in any way to the tensions over the school issue? KIRA (defensive) If you\\'re suggesting he was killed by a Bajoran just because he was from the Federation... BASHIR (shortcutting) The analysis proves he was killed the night before Vedek Winn arrived. There wasn\\'t any school issue yet. Kira looks satisfied. SISKO Any ideas about a motive? Silence. SISKO All right then, let\\'s start from the beginning. Ensign Aquino goes to make a repair to a power conduit... ODO One moment Commander, I\\'m not convinced of that... KIRA But the log... ODO It might have been altered by our killer to cover his tracks. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/06/93 - ACT FOUR 39. 31 CONTINUED: ODO I checked the Turbolift records the night of the murder. Aquino did take a Turbolift to level three but not to the power conduit where he was found... DAX Where did he go? ODO Runabout Pad \"C\"... O\\'BRIEN A runabout... ? What was he doing at a runabout at four in the morning? ODO Apparently, he was getting murdered. Off reactions... 32 INT. RUNABOUT AIRLOCK Neela works inside an open access panel on the side of the airlock corridor. O\\'Brien emerges from the runabout. O\\'BRIEN Everything in the runabout seems perfectly normal. NEELA It doesn\\'t look like the airlock systems have been tampered with. O\\'BRIEN (beat) Let\\'s run a level one diagnostic of the runabout\\'s computer interface, then we\\'ll call it a day. NEELA I already have. Everything\\'s normal. They sit on the floor by the open panel... letting go for a moment... DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/06/93 - ACT FOUR 40. 32 CONTINUED: O\\'BRIEN Hell, I don\\'t even know what we\\'re looking for. If anything happened here, it\\'s been pretty well covered up. Neela nods, frustrated, a quick brief shudder passes across her shoulders... softly vulnerable, and sad -- NEELA Did you know him well? O\\'BRIEN Aquino? Barely knew him at all. Just the welcome aboard, if you need anything speech. You? NEELA Not really. Bajoran and Starfleet officers don\\'t socialize too much... O\\'BRIEN How come? NEELA I don\\'t know. I guess we just keep to ourselves. O\\'BRIEN You\\'re not like that with me. NEELA (smiles) You\\'re not like the others. (off O\\'Brien\\'s curious reaction) You know. You don\\'t put on any airs... You\\'re just... nicer. She smiles warmly at him. A beat. And suddenly it\\'s just a little too intimate for O\\'Brien\\'s comfort... he gets up. O\\'BRIEN Well, uh, look, I\\'ll close up here... why don\\'t you take off... NEELA You sure? O\\'BRIEN (double meaning) Yeah. I\\'m sure. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/06/93 - ACT FOUR 41. 32 CONTINUED: (2) NEELA (smiles) Good night. She picks up her tool kit and EXITS, O\\'Brien watches her go a beat, starts to finish up his work... O\\'BRIEN (murmuring to himself) On your toes, O\\'Brien. A beat. His mind comes back to the investigation, taps his finger on the console... a new thought -- O\\'BRIEN Computer, expand diagnostic to include linkups to Runabout Pads A and B. COMPUTER VOICE Diagnostic initiated. Function will require three minutes forty seconds. O\\'Brien goes back to finishing up the work... 33 INT. PROMENADE Odo is observing the arrival through the airlock of many Bajorans... most of them dressed in traditional (Storyteller) garb... QUARK moves up beside him... QUARK You were looking for me? Odo grunts an acknowledgement, but is watching the faces of the arriving Bajorans... like a camera clicking them off for later reference... Quark follows his attention... QUARK Don\\'t tell me... there\\'s a Bajoran convention on the station that I didn\\'t know about... thanks, Odo, I need to call in more dabo girls... DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/06/93 - ACT FOUR 42-42A. 33 CONTINUED: ODO It\\'s not a convention. They\\'re from an orthodox spiritual order coming to support Vedek Winn\\'s efforts to keep the Bajoran children out of school... QUARK Orthodox. In that case, I\\'ll need twice as many dabo girls. These spiritual types love those dabo girls. Odo moves away from the airlock... they move slowly down the Promenade together... ODO This is not what I wanted to talk to you about. What do you know about the murder of Ensign Aquino? QUARK (reacts) You wound me. All the years together. I thought you knew me. Odo, I am not a killer. ODO No. But most of your friends are. QUARK True. And I would gladly sell one of them to you if I could. But unfortunately, none of them have taken credit for the death of the Starfleet officer. Sorry. In the background, O\\'Brien arrives, moving with a purpose, sees Odo, moves toward him... O\\'BRIEN Odo... Odo sees him coming, stops, getting rid of Quark -- ODO Keep your ears open. QUARK Are you kidding? That\\'s the seventh rule of acquisition. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/08/93 - ACT FOUR 43. 33 CONTINUED: (2) Quark acknowledges O\\'Brien, leaves... O\\'Brien hands Odo a small electronic component... O\\'BRIEN It\\'s a security bypass module. ODO You found this at Runabout Pad \"C\"? O\\'BRIEN No, that\\'s just it... it wasn\\'t at Pad \"C\"... that was clean as a whistle... just to be safe, I ran a diagnostic across the board and this showed up at pad \"A\"... ODO Pad \"A\"... ? O\\'BRIEN Aquino never went near Runabout \"A\"... Doesn\\'t make sense. ODO On the contrary, it makes perfect sense. Ensign Aquino goes to Runabout \"C\" because some sensor shows an anomaly in the security net there... he interrupts whoever is tampering with it and is killed. The killer puts the body in the conduit and instead of going back to pad \"C,\" which might be traced with Aquino\\'s Turbolift log, he changes his plan and moves to pad \"A.\" O\\'BRIEN But what was the plan? Everything else seems normal. ODO I\\'d guess somebody wanted to steal a runabout. O\\'BRIEN We\\'re not missing any. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/06/93 - ACT FOUR 44. 33 CONTINUED: (3) ODO Curious. They went to a lot of trouble to defeat the security net and then didn\\'t go through... Odo is interrupted by the SOUND of a HUGE EXPLOSION. People all over the Promenade are staggered by the blast. O\\'Brien immediately realizes... O\\'BRIEN The school. He bolts in that direction... Odo right behind him... 34 INT. PROMENADE - OUTSIDE KEIKO\\'S SCHOOL Odo and O\\'Brien round a curve in the Promenade to find Keiko\\'s school fully engulfed in flames. O\\'Brien tries to rush inside the school, but Odo grabs him. O\\'BRIEN Keiko... Fire BLASTS out of the schoolroom as it is rocked by a secondary explosion. 35 ANGLE ON O\\'BRIEN As the light from the flames flickers on his face. A beat later, Keiko runs around the bend and he sees her, and his eyes fill with tears of relief... as she reacts with shock... he moves to her, holds onto her for dear life... and as their embrace is framed by the fire... FADE OUT. END OF ACT FOUR DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/06/93 - ACT FIVE 45. ACT FIVE FADE IN: 36 INT. PROMENADE - OUTSIDE THE SCHOOLROOM A crowd has gathered to see the smoldering wreckage. Kira and Neela are examining the rubble. They are joined by Sisko and Odo. In the background, Odo\\'s two deputies control the crowd. O\\'Brien and Keiko are no longer there. SISKO What\\'ve you got? KIRA (consulting tricorder) I\\'m reading traces of cabrodine and infernite, common explosives, both easily obtained. ODO Then we\\'re looking at a simple, homemade bomb. Sisko nods his agreement, but is distracted by the wallah of the crowd. Looks to see -- 37 ANGLE - VEDEK WINN Approaching through the crowd... accompanied by her monk assistant... moves to Sisko, she looks very upset... WINN Where is Mrs. O\\'Brien? SISKO Her husband took her home. WINN Was she hurt? Was anyone hurt? SISKO No. WINN (relieved) The prophets have been kind today. SISKO (containing his anger) The prophets... had nothing to do with what happened here today. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/06/93 - ACT FIVE 46. 37 CONTINUED: SISKO (Cont\\'d) This was the work of a disturbed and violent mind... who listened to your voice... not to the prophets. WINN (with an edge) Is the Emissary holding me responsible for this act of terrorism? SISKO The commander of this station is. WINN May the prophets forgive you for abandoning them. She begins to move away... Sisko won\\'t let her get away so easily... louder, getting the attention of others... SISKO You claim the prophets as your personal constituency, Vedek Winn. I\\'m not convinced that\\'s justified. Who do you speak for? An order that is barely listened to in your assembly... so you come here looking for a more receptive audience. And now she turns, declaring war, cold as ice... WINN Is that what your friend, Vedek Bareil told you? He\\'s as misguided as you are. (beat) No, that\\'s not fair... you are not simply misguided... as I once thought. Now I see that you want nothing less than to destroy us. Sisko gives her more rope... DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/06/93 - ACT FIVE 47. 37 CONTINUED: (2) SISKO Destroy you... WINN You live without a soul, Commander. You and your Federation exist in a universe of darkness and you would drag us in there with you. But we... will... not... go. Sisko studies her, and finally relaxes, grins. SISKO You\\'ve just made your first mistake, Vedek. WINN Have I. SISKO The Bajoran people who have lived with us on this station... who have worked with us for months... who helped us move this station to protect the wormhole... who have joined us to explore the Gamma Quadrant... who have begun to build the future of Bajor with us... these people know that we are neither your enemy nor... the devil. His eyes find -- 38 ANGLE - INCLUDE KIRA as his words reach her. SISKO (continuing) We don\\'t always agree. We have some damn good fights in fact. But we always come away from them with a little more understanding and appreciation for each other. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/06/93 - ACT FIVE 48. 39 BACK TO WINN AND SISKO SISKO (continuing) You won\\'t succeed here. This school will reopen. When your rhetoric gets old, the Bajoran parents will bring their children back. WINN We\\'ll see. Sisko nods and EXITS through the crowd... stay a beat on Winn as she considers this... several of the orthodox move to the Vedek to express their support in walla... VOICES (WALLA) You\\'re right, Vedek... they\\'re godless... we should drive them out of there... this isn\\'t your fault... he had no right to say that... he will pay in eternity for his blasphemy... She doesn\\'t care about any of them, works her way through the crowd until by chance she makes eye contact with -- 40 ANGLE ON NEELA who looks at her. 41 WINN nods with recognition. 42 NEELA almost imperceptibly, acknowledges the nod. 43 INT. OPS Sisko ENTERS on the Turbolift... Dax and O\\'Brien are at their stations... he\\'s burying his fury in his work, working on his sensors... SISKO How is she, Chief? DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/08/93 - ACT FIVE 49. 43 CONTINUED: O\\'BRIEN Pretty shaken up, but she\\'s planning to hold classes tomorrow in one of the small cargo bays if that\\'s okay. SISKO (smiles) You tell her Jake\\'ll be there on time. O\\'BRIEN That\\'ll make her feel a lot better, sir. In the background, Kira, Neela and a Federation crewman arrive... SISKO Anything new on Aquino? O\\'BRIEN Yessir. I found a security bypass module at Runabout Pad \"A\"... looks like someone might have wanted to steal a runabout. That\\'s probably why Aquino went there in the first place... 44 ANGLE - NEELA who has arrived at the engineering station reacts as she hears this... O\\'BRIEN I\\'ve put security seals in place at all three pads... and I\\'m checking for any other anomalies down there... Sisko acknowledges... DAX Benjamin, incoming transmission from Vedek Bareil aboard a Bajoran transport... SISKO On screen...

BAREIL Commander, I\\'ve decided to accept your gracious invitation. SISKO Invitation? BAREIL (poker-faced) You did invite me to tour your facility... ? SISKO Yes, yes, of course, Vedek. We\\'d be honored. Unfortunately, we have some damage on our Promenade we won\\'t have time to clean up before you arrive. BAREIL Yes. I heard about it. (pointed) Perhaps I can help you clean it up. SISKO That would be very much appreciated. BAREIL It\\'s the least a friend can do. I look forward to seeing you again. The transmission ends. On Sisko\\'s delighted reaction... 46 INT. BAJORAN SHRINE Neela ENTERS the Bajoran Shrine, where Vedek Winn is talking quietly to her monk. Winn notices Neela... sends the other monk away. WINN (gently) My dear, you should not be here.

NEELA But if I go through with it now, I\\'ll be caught and executed. Winn takes her hands and looks deeply into her eyes... WINN Sometimes the sacrifices the prophets call on us to make are great, my child. But the rewards they give will last through eternity. Neela nods her understanding. 47 EXT.

Bareil takes one hand in both of his... studies her deeply... almost with love... mystical. BAREIL Nerys. I know more about you than you realize. I am very pleased to begin our friendship. KIRA (taken aback) Thank you. BAREIL (intimate) I realize you may disagree with me today... if your heart is with Vedek Winn, embrace her... KIRA (disconcerted) After what\\'s happened... I\\'m... not sure where my heart is, Bareil. BAREIL May the prophets allow me to be the one to help you find it again. Another long beat as he looks at her, smiles... takes her arm... Kira glances uneasily at Sisko as Sisko motions the way... DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/06/93 - ACT FIVE 53. 49 INT.

COMPUTER VOICE Chief of Operations Miles O\\'Brien. O\\'BRIEN Me? I never saw this file before. Override command. COMPUTER VOICE Unable to comply. State security code to release protection. He reacts, moves to the pit... O\\'BRIEN (to Dax) Lieutenant, I\\'ve got to do a manual isolation of an anomalous file... it\\'s in the security field subsystem... labelled \"A-N-A\"... DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/06/93 - ACT FIVE 54. 49 CONTINUED: DAX (off monitor) That file is going to be protected by a series of encryption sequences. I\\'ll run an adaptive program. O\\'BRIEN We\\'re lucky for once we\\'re dealing with a Cardassian computer... it shouldn\\'t have any more than seven sequences. DAX Beginning decryption. As a monitor in the pit lights up... the screen is filled with lists of rapidly changing numbers... O\\'BRIEN Online... patched to subroutine \"A- N-A\"... Dax\\'s monitor has them too... she presses a few panels... the first digit a \"4\" sticks and the computer continues to figure out the rest... 50 INT. PROMENADE Bareil, Sisko, Kira exit the airlock. The Promenade is crowded with people. Every Bajoran on the station is packed into either the upper or lower level. Odo and a handful of Deputies do what they can to control the crowd. Bashir comes out of the Infirmary to see. Bareil pauses to mix with the people, smiling, chatting, being spiritual... the people push forward to be close to the future Kai... arms reaching out, touching him... much Walla and excitement... moving to find at the back of the crowd... Neela... holding her tool box... 51 INT. OPS - CLOSE ON MONITOR (OPTICAL) which has now figured out six of the seven digits... and as the seventh one clicks into place... making \"4100RLX\"... move back to find O\\'Brien...

They frown. On the move -- O\\'BRIEN I\\'m going down there. DAX I\\'ll run a diagnostic on the other security systems and call you as soon as I have anything. O\\'Brien reaches the Turbolift... 53 INT. PROMENADE Bareil, Sisko, Kira and Bareil\\'s attache have made progress getting through the crowd with Odo\\'s help... moving to find Neela, being pushed in the crowd... a solemn, even expression on her face. 54 ANGLE as Bareil sees Winn and her monk near the temple... Bareil smiles and moves to her... she smiles, they embrace, pleasing the crowd... DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/08/93 - ACT FIVE 57. 54 CONTINUED: WINN I expected you sooner, Bareil. BAREIL It seems our paths have grown apart. Perhaps we can bring them together again. WINN Nothing would please me more. BAREIL Come with me to the school... let\\'s both show a commitment to the peaceful conclusion of this series of events... Just a touch of hesitation... WINN Of course. They move forward... making better progress this time... finding Neela again in the crowd... 55 NEW ANGLE to find O\\'Brien arriving, on the Turbolift... moving to security... 56 INT. SECURITY OFFICE O\\'Brien ENTERS, uses his tricorder to trace the subspace device... it leads him right back to the place where Neela had been working in Act One. O\\'Brien does a take... thinks about Neela... can\\'t believe it... O\\'BRIEN (off tricorder) Computer, is the subspace device integrated into the isolinear co- processor? COMPUTER VOICE Confirmed. O\\'BRIEN O\\'Brien to Dax. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/12/93 - ACT FIVE 58. 56 CONTINUED: DAX\\'S COM VOICE Go ahead. O\\'BRIEN It\\'s in the isolinear co-processor. DAX\\'S COM VOICE Didn\\'t you just repair that unit two days ago? O\\'BRIEN Yeah, I did... with Neela. 57 INT. PROMENADE - ON NEELA slowly moving between people, getting closer to the front of the crowd... they\\'ve reached the school now... the parents, Jake and Keiko are there... Bareil never lets go of Winn\\'s hand... BAREIL (to the crowd) Looking around at your faces... I believe you feel the shame that I feel at this sight... 58 INT. SECURITY OFFICE (VPB) O\\'Brien shaking his head, angry at himself for being a fool, for liking her, still not entirely believing it, not wanting to believe it, there\\'s gotta be a better explanation... he\\'s working a computer console... O\\'BRIEN It\\'s gotta be the weapon detectors on the Promenade... that\\'s the only thing those co-processors could possibly affect... DAX\\'S COM VOICE All weapon detectors appear to be functional, Chief... O\\'BRIEN (half to himself, convincing himself) No, that\\'s gotta be it... she\\'s real good... she could make it look like they\\'re normal... it\\'s gotta be the scanners... He sighs, it\\'s the only answer. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/06/93 - ACT FIVE 59. 58 CONTINUED: O\\'BRIEN O\\'Brien to Sisko... INTERCUTTING: 59 INT. PROMENADE Bareil is holding up one hand to quiet the crowd... he looks deeply saddened by what he sees, never let\\'s go of Winn\\'s hand... BAREIL Once our world was a center of learning... Sisko responding to O\\'Brien\\'s call, has taken a moment to move away from center stage to keep his conversation from disrupting Bareil... SISKO What\\'s up, Chief? O\\'BRIEN\\'S COM VOICE Sir, I\\'m not entirely sure... but I think the weapon detectors on the Promenade have been disabled. SISKO (instantly alert to the crowd) What do you mean you\\'re not sure? O\\'BRIEN\\'S COM VOICE I mean, I think Neela disabled them. SISKO Your assistant... ? O\\'BRIEN\\'S COM VOICE Yessir. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/06/93 - ACT FIVE 60. 59 CONTINUED: BAREIL (over the above) ... It attracted travelers from many other worlds... now, to see a schoolhouse destroyed, to see the pursuit of education halted... it is indeed a sad day for Bajor. The years of oppression have changed us. They have left us violent. They have left us afraid. They have left us distrustful. Sisko\\'s eyes scan the crowd... sees Neela moving closer to Bareil, reaching into her tool box... BAREIL It is time to forge a new beginning... to accept new ideas, not to be afraid of them... to reject violence as a solution, to join hands with all peoples and begin to trust again... Begin slow motion... 60 WINN\\'S HAND disconnects with Bareil\\'s... 61 KIRA just happens to be looking that way and notices... 62 BAREIL glances at Winn (and she is calm and placid as ever, only the hand gives her away)... 63 NEELA\\'S HAND pulls out a phaser... DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/06/93 - ACT FIVE 61. 64 SISKO charges into the crowd at her... SISKO No! 65 ODO turns to the sound of the voice... sees -- 66 SISKO pushing people out the way to get to her... 67 KIRA reacts, barely starts to move toward Bareil to protect him but she\\'s not sure from what... 68 NEELA raises the weapon... no one seems to notice, they\\'re all looking at Sisko... 69 ODO tries to get to... 70 BAREIL who looks perplexed by the commotion... 71 SISKO (OPTICAL) Slow motion ends as he gets to Neela and throws his body in the air... Neela sees him out of the corner of her eye, moves to get a better shot, he hits her arm as the gun discharges twice, hitting the ceiling... and now people are screaming, and scattering and all hell is breaking loose... 72 O\\'BRIEN comes out of security to see what the hell has happened... Keiko finds him, they lock arms... DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/06/93 - ACT FIVE 62. 73 ODO ushers Bareil, who is clearly shaken and pale, away to safety... 74 SISKO pulls Neela to her feet, having wrestled the gun away from her... NEELA (without apology) The prophets spoke. I answered their call. The prophets spoke. I answered their call. 75 ANGLE - WINN saying a silent prayer and as she looks up, she finds Kira staring at her... off Winn\\'s curious reaction -- KIRA (almost doesn\\'t believe it herself) It was all to get him here, wasn\\'t it. The school, the protests... the bombing. You knew that would bring him out of the monastery. You did it all to kill him, to stop him from becoming Kai. Winn studies her evenly for a long moment, chooses not to grace the accusation with a reply... moves quickly away... a beat on Kira\\'s reaction... 76 SISKO Sisko leads Neela toward security and they pass O\\'Brien and as he makes eye contact with Neela -- she says it again, but this time trying to personally explain it to him because she really does like him. NEELA The prophets spoke. I answered their call. And she disappears with Sisko inside. We stay on O\\'Brien\\'s reaction a beat and then ... 77 EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL) Re-establishing. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/06/93 - ACT FIVE 63. 78 INT. OPS It\\'s late at night now... a skeleton crew is in charge... in fact all we see is one Bajoran supernumerary in the background and she quickly moves out of sight... Sisko arrives, exhausted, on the Turbolift, reacts as he sees Kira sitting alone at her station at the table... staring ahead in thought... trying to make some sense out of all this... He moves beside her, lays a hand on her shoulder which breaks her trance. She looks up at him and he sits beside her. It\\'s a gentle, subdued moment between them. SISKO Neela insists she acted alone. Unless you want to consider the prophets co- conspirators. KIRA She\\'ll never tell us the truth. We\\'ll never be able to prove Winn was involved. SISKO (beat, studying her) You okay? KIRA (sighs) Okay... ? I\\'ve forgotten \"okay.\" Haven\\'t seen \"okay\" in what seems like years. (beat) I\\'ve been sitting here thinking. Last year at this time, I was fighting the Cardassians in some nameless swamp. If you\\'d\\'ve stopped by and told me in just one year, they\\'d be gone, and I\\'d be wearing a uniform, up here in charge of protecting some wormhole... SISKO ... protecting your celestial temple... KIRA (beat) I envied Vedek Winn because she was a true believer... I wanted my faith to be as strong as hers. DEEP SPACE: \"In the Hands... \" - REV. 04/06/93 - ACT FIVE 64. 78 CONTINUED: SISKO Maybe it is. Kira thinks that over. Sisko rises. SISKO I have a report to put together for Starfleet... you ought to get some rest... KIRA I\\'d rather help you... He nods, okay, come on... she rises... KIRA Commander... (beat) I heard what you said to Vedek Winn at the school. I just wanted you to know... you were right about the Bajorans here, about me at least... I don\\'t think you\\'re... (beat, using his words) ... \"the devil.\" He smiles warmly. SISKO Then I guess we\\'ve made some progress after all. She smiles back. He puts his arm around her shoulder and as they move into his office... 79 thru OMITTED 80 FADE OUT. END OF ACT FIVE THE END'"

       "\"Title: Endgame Stardate: 54973.4 Original Airdate: May 23, 2001 [2404 - San Francisco - Admiral Janeway's Apartment - night] (Voyager swoops over San Francisco amid fireworks) NEWSREADER [OC]: These should be familiar images to everyone who remembers the USS Voyager's triumphant return to Earth after twenty three years in the Delta quadrant. Voyager captivated the hearts and minds of people throughout the Federation, so it seems fitting that on this, the tenth anniversary of their return, we take a moment to recall the sacrifices made by the crew. Corruption charges were brought today against a Ferengi JANEWAY: Computer, end display. [ Admiral Janeway's Apartment - party] KIM: Hello. SABRINA: What's your name? KIM: Harry. What's yours? SABRINA: Sabrina. KIM: Naomi's daughter? SABRINA: A-ha. KIM: You've gotten so big. SABRINA: I don't remember you. KIM: I haven't come to one of these reunions in four years. SABRINA: Why? KIM: I've been on a deep space assignment. SABRINA: For four years? KIM: Compared to how long I was on Voyager, it seemed like a long weekend. Can you find your mother for me? SABRINA; A-ha. KIM: I'd like to say hi. JANEWAY: Oops, here you are Captain. KIM: Thank you, Admiral. I haven't seen her since she was a baby. JANEWAY: It's amazing how fast you've all grown. KIM: How's Tuvok? JANEWAY: Not well. KIM: I thought maybe I'd go see him tomorrow. JANEWAY: Oh, that would be nice. KIM: I'm sorry I missed the funeral. I should have been there. JANEWAY: You were on a mission. Everyone understood. It's so good to see you, Harry. PARIS: Doc! EMH: Mister Paris! Voyager's pilot, medic, and occasional thorn in my side. Where have you been hiding yourself? PARIS: I've been busy. EMH: New holo-novel? PARIS: I'll make sure to get your input before I send it off to my publisher. Aren't you going to introduce me to your date? EMH: Mister Paris meet Lana, my blushing bride. PARIS: You're married? LANA: Tomorrow is our two week anniversary. PARIS: Well, congratulations! My invitation must have gotten lost in subspace.. EMH: Oh, you should be flattered! We took a page from your book and eloped. LANA: Joe has a real flair for romantic gestures. PARIS: Joe? EMH: I decided I couldn't get married without a name. PARIS: It took you thirty three years to come up with Joe? EMH: It was Lana's grandfather's name. PARIS: Oh. Oh, so you're not a. LANA: A hologram? No. EMH: Frankly, Mister Paris, I'm surprised you'd even ask. I thought we were beyond those sorts of distinctions. PARIS: Are you kidding? I think it's great. I'm in a mixed marriage myself, remember? EMH: Speaking of which, where is that wife of yours? TORRES: The High Council had a lot of questions. JANEWAY: What did you tell them? TORRES: The truth, with a Klingon twist. I told them that my beloved former Captain, who had saved my life many times in glorious battle, would be honoured to submit Korath's house for consideration. JANEWAY: Do you think it will work? TORRES: I'm just the Federation liaison, but I'd like to think I have some influence. You still haven't told me why you're trying to help Korath. JANEWAY: He's an old friend. TORRES: Would this old friend have anything to do with the mission that you sent my daughter on? JANEWAY: Sorry, B'Elanna, but you know I can't talk about that. TORRES: Couldn't you at least have waited until after the reunion? She really wanted to be here. JANEWAY: She'll be home soon, I promise. BARCLAY: May I have everyone's attention, please! Ten years ago tonight, this crew returned home from the longest away mission in Starfleet's history. Twenty three years together made you a family, one I'm proud to have been adopted by, so let's raise our glasses to the journey. ALL: To the journey. JANEWAY: And to those who aren't here to celebrate it with us. [Starfleet classroom] BARCLAY: Ladies and gentlemen, meet the Borg. Over the course of this term, you're going to become intimately familiar with the Collective. You'll learn about the assimilation process, the Borg hierarchy, and the psychology of the hive mind, and when it comes to your performance in this class, my expectations are going to be no different than the Borg Queen herself. Perfection. This semester, we are very fortunate to have a special guest lecturer. The woman who literally wrote the book on the Borg, Admiral Kathryn Janeway. JANEWAY: Thank you, Commander, I'm glad to be here. A question already, cadet? CADET: I suppose it could wait until after class, Admiral. JANEWAY: As they say in the Temporal Mechanics Department, there's no time like the present. CADET: In the year 2378 you aided the Borg resistance movement known as Unimatrix Zero. BARCLAY: Sounds like someone's been reading ahead. JANEWAY: I thought you had a question, Cadet. CADET: Yes, Ma'am. When you informed the Queen that you were going to liberate thousands of her drones, could you describe the look on her face? FEMALE CADET: Admiral? Some of us were talking before class and we were curious. How extensive was Seven of Nine's involvement with Unimatrix Zero? JANEWAY: I'd, er, prefer not to discuss Seven of Nine. FEMALE CADET: Yes, ma'am. Sorry. JANEWAY: (Aide whispers in her ear) Excuse me. BARCLAY: Okay, er, who can tell me a little about nanotechnology? [Admiral Janeway's Office] MIRAL [on monitor]: I'm sorry to pull you out of class, Admiral. JANEWAY: Did you see it? MIRAL [on monitor]: Yes, ma'am. JANEWAY: And? MIRAL [on monitor]: It works. JANEWAY: Korath has agreed to the exchange? MIRAL [on monitor]: Yes. JANEWAY: But? MIRAL [on monitor]: He's insisting on handing it over to you personally. JANEWAY: I'll be there as soon as I can. Good work, Ensign Paris. [Starfleet Medical - Tuvok's room] JANEWAY: Hello, Tuvok. TUVOK: The light. JANEWAY: Oh, I'm sorry. TUVOK: I know you. JANEWAY: That's right. I'm your friend, Kathryn Janeway, remember? TUVOK: You're an impostor. JANEWAY: No, Tuvok. It's me. TUVOK: Admiral Janeway visits on Sunday. Today is Thursday. Logic dictates that you are not who you claim to be. JANEWAY: How are you? TUVOK: I am close to completing my work. JANEWAY: I'm glad to hear it. TUVOK: It is difficult with so many interruptions. JANEWAY: I'm sorry. Would you like me to leave? TUVOK: You may stay. JANEWAY: Tuvok, there's something I need to tell you. It's very important. I'm going away and I may not see you again. Commander Barclay and the Doctor will continue to visit. They'll bring you anything you need. TUVOK: The Doctor comes on Wednesdays. Commander Barclay's visits are erratic. JANEWAY: (leaves a picture of the senior staff on his dresser) Good-bye, Tuvok. [Admiral Janeway's Apartment] JANEWAY: You must be the only Doctor who still makes house calls. EMH: What are your symptoms? JANEWAY: I'm perfectly fine. EMH: For thirty three years you fought me every time you were due for a physical. Now you ask me to give you one ahead of schedule? JANEWAY: I'm taking a trip. I just wanted to get our appointment out of the way before I left. EMH: That's all? JANEWAY: That's all. EMH: Hmm. The good news is you're as healthy as you were the first day I examined you. JANEWAY: Now that's out of the way, have a seat. We didn't get to talk much at the party. EMH: No, I don't suppose we did. JANEWAY: So, how's married life? EMH: Wonderful. You should try it. JANEWAY: Oh, I think it's a little late for that. Marriage is for the young, like your wife. EMH: I can only hope she ages as gracefully as you have. I, of course, will be the same handsome hologram twenty years from now as I am today. JANEWAY: I've been meaning to ask you. Are you familiar with a drug called chronexaline? EMH: We've been testing it at Starfleet Medical to determine if it can protect biomatter from tachyon radiation. JANEWAY: And? EMH: It's very promising. Why do you ask? JANEWAY: I need two thousand milligrams by tomorrow afternoon. EMH: Why? JANEWAY: It's classified. Will you get it for me? EMH: Of course, Admiral. You'll have it by oh nine hundred. JANEWAY: Thank you. [Starfleet Communications] COMPUTER: Download complete. BARCLAY: This should be everything you need. JANEWAY: The shuttle? BARCLAY: Waiting for you at the Oakland shipyard. I wish you'd let me come with you. JANEWAY: Sorry, Reg, but this is my mission. Besides, if you leave there won't anyone to teach those eager young cadets about the Borg. BARCLAY: Oh, I made you some fresh tea for the trip. Not that replicated stuff. JANEWAY: Thank you, for everything. I wouldn't have been able to do this without you. BARCLAY: Oh, don't remind me. [Hillside - Chakotay's grave] JANEWAY: Any final words of advice for your old Captain? Wait, don't tell me. I'm being impulsive, I haven't considered all the consequences, it's too risky. Thanks for the input but I've got to do what I think is right. I know it wasn't easy living all these years without her Chakotay, but when I'm through things might be better for all of us. Trust me. [2378 - USS Voyager - Torres-Paris' Quarters] TORRES: Tom. Tom! PARIS: I'm sleeping. TORRES: It's time. PARIS: For what? TORRES: I'll give you one guess. PARIS: Paris to (finds comm. badge) Paris to Sickbay, it's time. EMH [OC]: Relax, Mister Paris. Can she stand? PARIS: Affirmative. EMH [OC]: Then I suggest you report to Sickbay. PARIS: What about B'Elanna? EMH [OC]: Her, too. PARIS: Right, of course. Maybe we should take the transporter. Hey, wait for me! [Sickbay] EMH: Hmm. PARIS: What do you mean by hmm? EMH: You're going to have a very healthy baby, but not tonight. TORRES: Tell me you're joking. EMH: You're experiencing false labour, Lieutenant. PARIS: Again? EMH: As I explained the last time it's a common occurrence, especially among Klingons. TORRES: I want this thing out of me now! EMH: Misdirected rage. Another common occurrence among Klingons. PARIS: Can't you induce? EMH: I wouldn't recommend it . PARIS: If this keeps happening, we'll never get any sleep. EMH: You think it's bad now? [Ready room] JANEWAY: When? CHAKOTAY: Oh four hundred. JANEWAY: How many false alarms does that make? CHAKOTAY: Three that we know of. JANEWAY: That baby is as stubborn as her mother. CHAKOTAY: Harry's starting a pool to see who can guess the actual date and time of birth. JANEWAY: Tell him to put me down for next Friday, twenty three hundred hours. Anything else? CHAKOTAY: Crewman Chell's asked about taking over in the Mess hall full-time. JANEWAY: Neelix left some pretty big pots and pans to fill. Does Mister Chell feel he's up to the challenge? CHAKOTAY: Apparently so. He's prepared a sample menu. JANEWAY: Plasma leek soup? Chicken warp cor-don bleu. CHAKOTAY: If his cooking's as bad as his puns, we're in trouble. JANEWAY: Oh, I don't know. I wouldn't mind giving his red alert chilli a try. Feel like having lunch? CHAKOTAY: I'd love to, but I've already made plans. Rain check? JANEWAY: Absolutely. [Cargo Bay two] CHAKOTAY: What's all this? SEVEN: A picnic. According to my research this is an appropriate third date. CHAKOTAY: You didn't have to go to this much trouble. SEVEN: If this makes you uncomfortable I could prepare a less elaborate meal. CHAKOTAY: No, don't change a thing. This is perfection. [Mess hall] TUVOK: In the interest of fair play, I should inform you that Mister Kim has never defeated me at kal-toh. KIM: You should've listened to me. TUVOK: Kal-toh is as much a game of patience as it is of logic. An experienced player will sometimes take several hours to decide his next move, and in some cases even days may be necessary to ICHEB: Kal-toh. KIM: You beat him! TUVOK: Congratulations. ICHEB: I'm sure it was just beginner's luck, sir. I'd offer you a rematch, but I'm due in Astrometrics. TUVOK Another time, perhaps. KIM: He may have to go, but I'm free and feeling lucky. TUVOK: If you'll excuse me, Ensign. KIM: It's just a game, Tuvok. [Sickbay] EMH: Icheb's an exceptionally bright young man. Did it occur to you that he might simply be a better player? TUVOK: My loss was the result of another lapse in concentration. EMH: I am detecting lower neuro-peptide levels. TUVOK: As I suspected, my condition is deteriorating. EMH: It's a minor change. We knew it would happen. I simply have to increase your medication. TUVOK: Thank you, Doctor. EMH: Commander, I understand your desire for privacy but maybe it's time we informed the Captain. TUVOK: I will inform her if and when the disorder begins to affect the performance of my duties. EMH: Of course. [Astrometrics lab] SEVEN: Your move. NEELIX [on screen] Green, grid twelve ten. SEVEN: Red, grid three thirteen. NEELIX [on screen]: Tricky. SEVEN: How's Brax? NEELIX [on screen]: Wonderful. Thanks for asking. I know I can never replace his father, but SEVEN: I have no doubt the boy looks up to you. NEELIX [on screen]: Orange, grid ten twelve. I haven't told anyone, but I'm thinking of asking Dexa to marry me. SEVEN: She'd be wise to accept. NEELIX [on screen]: That's enough of my love life. How about yours? SEVEN: I don't have a love life. NEELIX [on screen]: Oh? What about your relationship with Commander Chakotay? SEVEN: It's your turn. NEELIX [on screen]: Actually, it's yours. At least tell me how he liked the picnic. SEVEN: It was an enjoyable activity for both of us. Thank you for suggesting it. NEELIX [on screen]: Any time. What is it? SEVEN: Long-range sensors are detecting extremely high neutrino emissions accompanied by intermittent graviton flux approximately three light years away. NEELIX [on screen]: A wormhole? SEVEN: I'm not sure. I'll need to conduct more scans. NEELIX [on screen]: We can finish our game tomorrow. SEVEN: I'll contact you at the usual time. [Briefing room] SEVEN: The emissions are occurring at the centre of the nebula. There appear to be hundreds of distinct sources. KIM: Which could translate to hundreds of wormholes. SEVEN: The radiation is interfering with our sensors, but if Ensign Kim's enthusiasm turns out to be justified, it would be the most concentrated occurrence of wormholes ever recorded. JANEWAY: Any idea where they lead? KIM: Not yet, but if just one of them leads to the Alpha quadrant. PARIS: Who knows, Harry? It might take us right into your parents' living room. JANEWAY: Alter course, Mister Paris. Ensign, when you speak to your mother tell her we may need her to move the sofa. [2404 - Starfleet Medical - Tuvok's room] TUVOK: 7153 5331 7153 5331 7153. PHYSICIAN: Sorry if I pulled you away from something important, sir, but he won't let anyone near him and I thought you might EMH: You did the right thing. His condition's never been associated with violent behaviour, PHYSICIAN: He seems more frustrated than violent. TUVOK: Long-range sensors have detected no trace. Her disappearance remains a mystery. I am deeply concerned. EMH: What are you concerned about, Tuvok? JANEWAY: Her disappearance. EMH: Whose? TUVOK: 5331 7153. PHYSICIAN: He's been repeating those same numbers over and over again. 533171. It might be a stardate. EMH: Stardate 53317. If my memory files are accurate, that was the day Captain Janeway was abducted by the Kellidians. Is that who you're talking about, Tuvok? Captain Janeway? TUVOK: Her disappearance remains a mystery. EMH: No, you solved that mystery, Tuvok. You rescued the Captain and brought her back to Voyager safe and sound. Remember? TUVOK: I am deeply concerned, deeply concerned. PHYSICIAN: Do you think if the Admiral paid him a visit, showed him that she was all right? EMH: Unfortunately, she's out of town right now. I'm not sure when she'll be back. TUVOK: She's never coming back. Her disappearance remains a mystery. I'm deeply concerned, deeply concerned. [Barclay's office] EMH: Voyager to Pathfinder. Come in, Pathfinder. BARCLAY: Doctor! What a pleasant sur.. Oh, I've forgotten about our golf game again, haven't I? JANEWAY: Relax, Reg, it's not until next week. I'm here because I need to get in touch with Admiral Janeway. BARCLAY: Oh, she's out of town. EMH: I know. Did she tell you where she was going? BARCLAY: I'm afraid it, it never came up. I mean, is something wrong? EMH: I'm not sure. I paid a visit to Tuvok this morning. He seemed to think that she was in some sort of danger. BARCLAY: Well, you know better than anyone how confused Tuvok can get. EMH: Yes, but I've been worried about the Admiral, too. BARCLAY: Why? EMH: Two days ago, she asked me for a large quantity of an experimental medication. When I asked her why she needed it, she said it was classified. BARCLAY: Then you shouldn't be telling me about it, should you? EMH: I spoke to Director Okaro at Starfleet Intelligence. He assured me that the Admiral hasn't been involved in any classified work since she began teaching at the Academy. BARCLAY: You know how sneaky these Intelligence people can be. Maybe he was just trying to throw you off. EMH: Maybe, but still, she's been talking for months about how excited she is to be teaching with you. Then, just as the semester begins, she goes away without even telling you where. Don't you find that a little strange? BARCLAY: I, I'm sure that there is a perfectly reasonable explanation, Doctor. I'm sorry, I have some p-papers to grade. EMH: You're stammering, Reg. BARCLAY: S-s-so? EMH: I haven't heard you do that in years. I think you do know where she is. BARCLAY: She is one of the most decorated officers in all of Starfleet history, and I'm, I'm sure she can take care of herself. EMH: You wouldn't be saying that unless she was doing something dangerous. BARCLAY: You are putting words in my mouth. EMH: Tell me where she is, Reg. [Cavern] MIRAL: Welcome to the House of Korath, Admiral. JANEWAY: I love what he's done with the place. KLINGON: (something aggressive) MIRAL: PetaQ! (and other stuff) JANEWAY: What was that about? MIRAL: He says your demeanour was disrespectful. JANEWAY: I hope you told him I didn't mean to be rude. MIRAL: I told him if he didn't show you more respect I would break his arm. JANEWAY: You are your mother's daughter. MIRAL: Korath is waiting. We should go in. JANEWAY: Sorry, but this is where we part ways. MIRAL: Excuse me? JANEWAY: You're dismissed, Ensign. MIRAL: But, Admiral, I really think that. JANEWAY: I can take care of myself. MIRAL: With all due respect, I've been working on this for six months, and JANEWAY: And you've done an exemplary job, but it's over. Understood? MIRAL: Yes, ma'am. JANEWAY: I happen to know your parents are anxious to spend some time with you. Take a few days leave. Go and see them. [Inner chamber] KORATH: A Cardassian disruptor. I've modified it to emit a nadion pulse. JANEWAY: Impressive, but that's not what I've come for. KORATH: No, you've come for something far more dangerous. JANEWAY: Where is it? KORATH: Somewhere safe. JANEWAY: I went to a great deal of trouble to get you your seat on the High Council. Now give me what you promised. KORATH: I've scanned your shuttle. It appears that you've made some interesting modifications. Your shields generator is of particular interest. JANEWAY: It's not for sale. KORATH: Then what you want isn't available either. JANEWAY: We had an agreement. KORATH: Show the Admiral out. [2378 - Bridge] PARIS: Maybe Chell should add Nebula Soup to his menu. JANEWAY: Shields. TUVOK: Holding. JANEWAY: Bridge to Astrometrics. SEVEN [OC]: Go ahead. JANEWAY: Any more data on those neutrino emissions? [Astrometrics lab] SEVEN: Negative, Captain. I still can't get a clear scan. JANEWAY [OC]: Distance to the centre? SEVEN: Six million kilometres. [Bridge] JANEWAY: What is it? TUVOK: I'm detecting a tritanium signature, bearing three four two, mark five five. PARIS: Whatever it is, it's too close. JANEWAY: Evasive manoeuvres. CHAKOTAY: Is it a ship? TUVOK: Possibly. KIM: Another tritanium signature, right on top of us. JANEWAY: Tom! (Borg cube passes) Get us out of here now. [Borg Queen's chamber] BORG [OC]: Vessel identified: USS Voyager. We will pursue and assimilate. QUEEN: No. They haven't compromised our security. Let the vessel continue for now. I'll keep an eye on them. [Briefing room] TUVOK: There's no evidence that the cube detected us. CHAKOTAY; Where is it now? SEVEN: Approximately three light years away. PARIS: How could they not have seen us? We came within ten metres of their hull! TUVOK: The Borg wouldn't knowingly risk a collision. The radiation must have interfered with their sensors as well. KIM: If they can't detect us, we should go back. SEVEN: I wouldn't recommend it. My analysis of the tritanium signature suggests there were at least forty seven Borg vessels inside the nebula. KIM: We can't just give up on those wormholes. JANEWAY: Oh yes we can. KIM: What if we try to modify JANEWAY: I'm sorry, Mister Kim. You may be the Captain someday, but not today. [Corridor] KIM: Tom, what are you doing when your shift ends? PARIS: No plans. Why? KIM: I've been thinking. You and I should have some fun. One last adventure before you get too busy being a father. PARIS: Did you reserve some holodeck time? KIM: I've got a better idea. (hands him a PADD) PARIS: This is your idea of fun? KIM: It'll work. We just need to make a few modifications to the Flyer. PARIS:: We might as well just hand it over to the Borg. KIM: How could that happen with the best pilot in the quadrant at the helm? PARIS: Nice try. KIM: If we go to the Captain together, she'll be much more likely to approve my plan. PARIS: I don't want her to approve it. KIM: Where's your sense of adventure? PARIS: I left it in that nebula and I'm not going back for it. KIM: Don't you want to find a way home? PARIS: I am home, Harry. (enters turbolift) KIM: Captain Proton would never walk away from a mission like this. PARIS: Captain Proton doesn't have a wife and a baby on the way. [Astrometrics lab] SEVEN: If you're here for my daily report, it's not complete. CHAKOTAY: Actually I'm here in an unofficial capacity. I was wondering if you'd like to get together again. SEVEN: To do what? CHAKOTAY: Well, that all depends on your research. Would a quiet dinner be an appropriate fourth date? SEVEN: I believe it would be a more suitable fifth date. CHAKOTAY: I'm willing to skip ahead if you are. [Sickbay] EMH: You're fine, aside from some minor inflammation around your biradial clamp. Let me know if it starts to bother you. Is there something else? SEVEN: Do you remember three months ago, when my cortical node shut down? EMH: How could I forget. SEVEN: You said it might be possible to remove the fail-safe device that was causing the problem. EMH: Has it been giving you trouble again? SEVEN: No, but I've reconsidered your offer to extract it. EMH: I've been hoping you would. SEVEN: You said it would require several surgeries. EMH: Actually, in anticipation of your change of heart, I've been studying the problem in more detail. I now believe I can reconfigure the microcircuitry with a single procedure. You'll be free to experience the full ranges of emotions. Everything from a hearty belly laugh to a good cry. SEVEN: How soon can you do it? EMH: Today, if you'd like. SEVEN: My shift ends at eighteen hundred hours. EMH: It's a date. Speaking of dates, once the fail-safe is gone, you'll be free to pursue more intimate relationships. SEVEN: I'm aware of that. EMH: If you decide you need help with that aspect of your humanity I'm always at your disposal. SEVEN: I appreciate that. EMH: Really? SEVEN: Yes, but I already have all the help I need. EMH: Ah, of course. You'll undoubtedly be running more simulations with the Chakotay hologram. SEVEN: No, actually. I'll see you at eighteen hundred hours. [2404 - Inner chamber] KLINGON: Maktah hoon Janeway takt. JANEWAY: I've reconsidered your offer. KORATH: I thought you might. JANEWAY: I'll give you the shield emitter but not until I've inspected the device you're offering, to make sure it's genuine. KORATH: You question my honour? JANEWAY: If you were honourable, you wouldn't have changed the terms of our agreement. Show it to me, or I'm leaving. (masking forcefield is lowered) This'll do just fine. (beams away with it) KORATH: Stop her! [Shuttlecraft] JANEWAY: Computer, deploy armour. Lay in a course for these co-ordinates. What do you want? KORATH [on monitor]: You'll pay for your deceit, ghuy'cha! The House of Korath won't rest until you've drowned in your own blood! JANEWAY: I'd love to stay and chat but I'm on a tight schedule. Computer, warp six. COMPUTER: Approaching designated co-ordinates. JANEWAY: All stop. COMPUTER: Warning, vessel approaching, vector one two one mark six. JANEWAY: Harry. And people are always saying that space is so big. KIM [on monitor]: Lower your shields, Admiral. Prepare for transport. I'm taking you into custody. JANEWAY: You have no grounds to take me into custody, Captain. KIM [on monitor]: Reg told the Doctor everything, and the Doctor told me. Now please, Admiral, stand down. JANEWAY: On one condition. You let me explain why I'm doing this. [USS Rhode Island - Kim's Ready room] KIM: You have no idea what the consequences would be. JANEWAY: I know what the consequences are if we do nothing. So do you. I have a chance to change all that. KIM: If Starfleet Command knew what you were trying to do. JANEWAY: You haven't told them? KIM: The Doctor and I decided to keep things in the family. JANEWAY: What about your crew? KIM: I told them I needed to take you back to Starfleet Medical because you'd contracted a rare disease. JANEWAY: I hope it isn't terminal. KIM: No, but it has been known to affect judgment. JANEWAY: I know what I'm doing, Harry. KIM: Do you? Can you say with absolute certainty that it'll work? Because if you can't. Even if it weren't a violation of every rule in the book, it would still be far too risky. What. JANEWAY: I'm remembering a young Ensign who wanted to fly into a Borg-infested nebula, just to explore the remote possibility that we might find a way home. KIM: If I remember correctly, you stopped me. JANEWAY: We didn't know then what we know now. KIM: Our technology may have advanced, but JANEWAY: I'm not talking about technology, I'm talking about people. People who weren't as lucky as you and me. You said you and the Doctor wanted to keep things in the family, but our family's not complete anymore, is it. I'm asking you to trust my judgment, Harry, one last time. [2378 - Chakotay's quarters] SEVEN: (beams in) Am I early? CHAKOTAY: No, you're right on time. Something wrong with the door? SEVEN: I didn't think it would be discreet to be seen carrying flowers to the First Officer's quarters. CHAKOTAY: Your research? I should put these in water. (she kisses him) SEVEN: I've been told that anticipation of the first kiss is often uncomfortable. I wanted to alleviate the tension. CHAKOTAY: That was very considerate of you. What about the second kiss? SEVEN: I'd have to check the database. It may indicate (he kisses her) JANEWAY [OC]: Senior officers report to the Bridge. CHAKOTAY: Next time we deactivate the comm. system. [Bridge] CHAKOTAY: What is it? JANEWAY: Judging from the tachyon emissions, some sort of temporal rift. SEVEN: How's it being generated? JANEWAY: That's what we're trying to figure out. [2404 - Janeway's shuttle] KIM: If Starfleet Command finds out I had anything to do with this, they'll demote me back to Ensign. JANEWAY: You worry too much, Harry. It's turning you grey. KIM: Propulsion's online, plasma flow stable. This device of Korath's, it produces too much tachyo-kinetic energy. It could burn itself out by the time you get where you're going. You wouldn't be able to get back. JANEWAY: I always assumed it was a one-way trip. KIM: You're sure I can't talk you out of this? Right, stupid question. (she hugs him) Kim to the Rhode Island, one to beam back. JANEWAY: Computer, activate the chrono-deflector. Deploy armour. COMPUTER: Unable to comply. Ablative generator is offline. JANEWAY: Evasive pattern beta six. Open a channel to the Rhode Island. KIM: Harry, I'm under attack. How fast can you get back here? [2378 - Bridge] TUVOK: I'm detecting nadion discharges on the other side of the rift. CHAKOTAY: Weapons fire? TUVOK: It's possible. The signature appears to be Klingon. JANEWAY: Red alert. [2404 - Janeway's shuttle] KIM [OC]: Stand by for transport, Admiral. JANEWAY: You know where I'm going, Harry, and it's not to your ship. KIM [OC]: Your structural integrity is failing. JANEWAY: Just get these Klingons off my tail. Computer, activate the tachyon pulse and direct it to these spatial and temporal co-ordinates. [2378 - Bridge] TUVOK: There's a vessel coming through the rift. CHAKOTAY: Klingon? TUVOK: No, Federation. KIM: We're being hailed. JANEWAY: Onscreen. ADMIRAL [on viewscreen]: Recalibrate your deflector to emit an anti-tachyon pulse. You have to seal that rift. JANEWAY It's usually considered polite to introduce yourself before you start giving orders. TUVOK: Captain, a Klingon vessel is coming through. ADMIRAL [on viewscreen]: Close the rift. In case you didn't notice, I outrank you, Captain. Now do it. JANEWAY: I did what you asked. Now tell me what the hell is going on. [Borg Queen's chamber] ADMIRAL [on monitor]: I've come to bring Voyager home. [Transporter room] JANEWAY: Welcome aboard. ADMIRAL: It's good to be back. [Ready room] ADMIRAL: Fresh coffee. JANEWAY: Would you like a cup? ADMIRAL: No, I gave it up years ago. I only drink tea now. I told the curator at the museum that if he wanted to make the Ready room more authentic, he should always keep a steaming pot of coffee on the desk. JANEWAY: Voyager's in a museum? ADMIRAL: Voyager is a museum on the grounds of the Presidio. On a clear morning, you can see Alcatraz from here. JANEWAY: You made it back to Earth. ADMIRAL: Unfortunately, our favourite cup took a bit of a beating along the way. It was damaged during a battle with the Fen Domar. JANEWAY: Who? ADMIRAL: You'll run into them in a few years. JANEWAY: You know what? I shouldn't be listening to details about the future. ADMIRAL: Oh, the almighty Temporal Prime Directive take my advice. It's less of a headache if you just ignore it. JANEWAY: You've obviously decided to, or you wouldn't be here. ADMIRAL: A lot's happened to me since I was you. JANEWAY: Well, I'm still me, and this is still my ship, so no more talk about what's going to happen until I decide otherwise. Understood? ADMIRAL: All right. Let's talk about the past. Three days ago, you detected elevated neutrino emissions in a nebula in grid nine eight six. You thought it might be a way home. You were right. I've come to tell you to take Voyager back to that nebula. JANEWAY: It was crawling with Borg. ADMIRAL: I've brought technology that'll get us past them. Oh, I don't blame you for being sceptical, but if you can't trust yourself, who can you trust? JANEWAY: For the sake of argument, let's say I believe everything you're telling me. The future you come from sounds pretty good. Voyager's home, I'm an Admiral, there are ways to defend against the Borg. My ready room even gets preserved for posterity. ADMIRAL: So, why would you want to tamper with such a rosy timeline? To answer that I'd have to tell you more than you want to know, but suffice it to say, if you don't do what I'm suggesting it's going to take you another sixteen years to get this ship home, and there are going to be casualties along the way. I know exactly what you're thinking. JANEWAY: You've also become a telepath? ADMIRAL: I used to be you, remember? You're asking yourself, is she really who she says she is or is this some sort of deception? For all you know, I could be a member of species 8472 in disguise. Have your people examine my shuttle. Tell them to take a close look at the weapons systems and the armour technology. In the meantime, the Doctor can confirm my identity. [Sickbay] EMH: My scans of the Admiral's cerebral cortex turned up something interesting, JANEWAY: What is it? EMH: I'm not sure. I've never seen this kind of implant before. JANEWAY: Alien technology? EMH: The microcircuitry has a Starfleet signature. ADMIRAL: Of course it does. EMH: Admiral? ADMIRAL: You invented it, twelve years ago from my perspective. EMH: I'm sorry, Admiral, I didn't realise. ADMIRAL: What, that I was eavesdropping? I may be old, but my hearing's still excellent thanks to your exemplary care over the years. EMH: So, this implant I'm going to invent. What does it do? ADMIRAL: It's a synaptic transceiver. It allows me to pilot a vessel equipped with a neural interface. EMH: Fascinating. Tell me, what other extraordinary breakthroughs am I going to make? JANEWAY: Doctor! EMH: Sorry, Captain, but you can't blame a hologram for being curious. JANEWAY: Just finish your report. EMH: Yes, ma'am. My scans indicate the two of you are genetically identical. The admiral is you, approximately twenty six years from now. ADMIRAL: Hello, Seven. SEVEN: The technology aboard the Admiral's ship is impressive. Much of it appears to have been designed to defend against the Borg. JANEWAY: Could we install these systems on Voyager? SEVEN: The stealth technology is incompatible but I believe we can adapt the armour and weapons. ADMIRAL: Well, Captain? JANEWAY: Do it. Captain's personal log, stardate 54973.4. We've begun outfitting Voyager with Admiral Janeway's upgrades. As soon as the major modifications are complete we'll reverse course and head back to the nebula. Though I've certainly had some strange experiences in my career, nothing quite compares to the sight of my future self briefing my officers on technology that hasn't been invented yet. [Cargo Bay two] SEVEN: Computer, begin regeneration cycle. QUEEN: Seven of Nine, tertiary adjunct of Unimatrix Zero One. It's been too long. SEVEN: What do you want? QUEEN: Do I need a reason to visit a friend? SEVEN: We're not friends. QUEEN: No, we're more than that, we're family. And while we're on the subject of old friends, I see that Voyager has just gotten a visitor and she's come from the future. Tell me why. SEVEN: You may be able to communicate with me while I'm regenerating but I'm no longer a drone. I don't answer to you. QUEEN: I've extrapolated Voyager's trajectory. I know that you're returning to the nebula. I suggest you alter course. SEVEN: Why should we comply? QUEEN: You've always been my favourite, Seven. In spite of their obvious imperfections. I know how much you care for the Voyager crew, so I've left them alone. Imagine how you'd feel if I were forced to assimilate them. SEVEN: Voyager is no threat to the Collective. We simply want to return to the Alpha quadrant. QUEEN: I've no objection to that but if you try to enter my nebula again, I'll destroy you. (Seven collapses) COMPUTER: Warning, regeneration cycle incomplete. [Sickbay] EMH: Her cortical node was exposed to a low-energy EM surge. It could have been much worse. SEVEN: It was the Borg Queen. She wanted to make sure I'd be able to deliver a message. She said she'd assimilate Voyager if we attempted to re-enter the nebula. JANEWAY: Why is it so important to her? ADMIRAL: It doesn't matter. She's not going to be able to make good on her threat. JANEWAY: I wish I shared your confidence. ADMIRAL: You would if you'd had as much experience with the Queen as I've had. JANEWAY: It was one thing to attempt this when we thought it was a secret but if the Borg are monitoring us. ADMIRAL: There's no guarantee they won't try to assimilate Voyager even if we don't go back into the nebula. EMH: Is that supposed to be reassuring? ADMIRAL: I'm not saying the Borg aren't dangerous, but from my perspective they're thirty years behind the times. JANEWAY: We shouldn't push our luck. ADMIRAL: Luck's not going to have anything to do with it. I know, you don't want to hear too much about the future, but let's just say I ran into the Borg a few more times before I made it home. If I hadn't developed technology and tactics that could defeat them, I wouldn't be standing here today. JANEWAY: We'll maintain course for the nebula but we'll stay at red alert, and I want continuous scans for Borg activity. [Astrometrics lab] CHAKOTAY: I heard what happened. Are you all right? SEVEN: I'm fine. CHAKOTAY: Because if you need time to rest I am in charge of the duty roster. SEVEN: It would be inappropriate to allow our personal relationship to affect your command decisions. CHAKOTAY: You're right. This is a time to keep things professional. Report! SEVEN: There's no sign of Borg activity within a ten light year radius. CHAKOTAY: That's good news, Crewman. SEVEN: Yes, Sir, but we shouldn't underestimate the Collective. CHAKOTAY: The Admiral seems confident we can make it past them. SEVEN: Captain Janeway is more cautious. CHAKOTAY: Our chances would be good with one Kathryn Janeway on the Bridge but with two, I'd bet on this ship any day. If we do make it back to Earth, what are your plans? SEVEN: I assume Starfleet will want to debrief me, and then I suppose I'll attempt to find a useful position somewhere. You? CHAKOTAY: I don't know yet either, but wherever I end up, I'm going to make sure it's in transporter range of you. [Engineering] TORRES: I don't want this whole system crashing because of one faulty relay. Install new ones. CREWMEN: Yes, ma'am. TORRES: And I need an update on the inductor capacitance. CREWWOMAN: Yes Lieutenant. PARIS: B'Elanna. TORRES: Shouldn't you be on the Bridge? PARIS: Is there something wrong with a pilot requesting a systems report from the Chief Engineer? TORRES: The last report I got said the comm. system was working perfectly. PARIS: Okay, you caught me. I'm checking up on you. TORRES: I'm fine. PARIS: Your back? TORRES: I'm ignoring it. PARIS: Well, I would offer to give you a massage but then, everybody would want one. TORRES: You know, for a Starfleet flyboy you're pretty sweet. PARIS: So how's it going? TORRES: This armour technology that the Admiral brought? It's incredible. I hate to sound like Harry, but we might actually make it this time. PARIS: Well, you don't seem too happy about that. TORRES: Oh, I'm happy. It's just that I'd actually gotten used to the idea of raising our daughter on Voyager and now I might end up delivering her at Starfleet Medical instead of Sickbay. PARIS: That wouldn't be so bad, would it? TORRES: Not as long as you're with me, and I want the Doctor. I don't want some stranger. PARIS: You would have to take him offline to keep him away. TORRES: If we do make it home, where do you think we'll live? PARIS: Well, we could always stay with my parents for a while. You're right, bad idea. TORRES: Of course, it probably doesn't matter to you anyway. You flyboys are all the same. You'll probably take the first piloting assignment that comes along and leave me home to change the diapers. PARIS: Not a chance. (kisses her) [Bridge] JANEWAY: Bridge to Engineering. TORRES [OC]: Go ahead, Captain. JANEWAY: Deploy armour. TORRES [OC]: Yes, ma'am. (The Queen watches as Cubes fire at Voyager) TUVOK: Armour integrity at ninety seven percent. JANEWAY: Tuvok? TUVOK: Integrity holding at ninety percent. JANEWAY: Maintain course. ADMIRAL: They're looking for ways to adapt. TUVOK: Port armour integrity down to fifty percent, forty percent. JANEWAY: Mister Paris, attack pattern alpha one. Target the lead cube and fire transphasic torpedoes. (Cube explodes) Target the second cube. CHAKOTAY: Distance to the centre? SEVEN: Less than one hundred thousand kilometres. JANEWAY: What the hell is it? ADMIRAL: Mister Paris, alter course to enter the aperture at co-ordinates three four six by four two. JANEWAY: Belay that. I asked you a question. What is it? ADMIRAL: The road home. SEVEN: It's more than that. It's a transwarp hub. JANEWAY: You once told me there were only six of them in the galaxy. SEVEN: That's correct. JANEWAY: You knew this was here, but you didn't tell me about it. Why? ADMIRAL: I'll answer all your questions once we're back in the Alpha quadrant. JANEWAY: Take us out of the nebula. PARIS: Captain? JANEWAY: You heard me. ADMIRAL: I gave you an order, Lieutenant. Proceed to the aperture. JANEWAY: This is my Bridge, Admiral, and I'll have you removed if necessary. Take us out. PARIS: Aye, Captain. [Astrometrics lab] SEVEN: This hub connects with thousands of transwarp conduits with end points in all four quadrants. It allows the Collective to deploy vessels almost anywhere in the galaxy within minutes. TUVOK: Of all the Borg's tactical advantages, this could be the most significant. CHAKOTAY: It's no wonder the Queen didn't want us in that nebula. JANEWAY: So how do we destroy it? SEVEN: Structure is supported by a series of interspatial manifolds. If we could disable enough of them, theoretically the hub would collapse. ADMIRAL: This is a waste of time. The shielding for those manifolds is regulated from the central nexus by the Queen herself. You might be able to damage one of them, maybe two, but by the time you moved onto the third, she'd adapt. JANEWAY: There may be a way to bring them down simultaneously. ADMIRAL: From where, inside the hub? Voyager would be crushed like a bug. CHAKOTAY: What about taking the conduit back to the Alpha quadrant and then destroying the structure from the other side? ADMIRAL: This hub is here. There's nothing in the Alpha quadrant but exit apertures. While you're all standing around dreaming up fantasy tactical scenarios, the Queen is studying her scans of our armour and weapons, and she's probably got the entire Collective working on a way to counter them. So take the ship back into that nebula and go home before it's too late. JANEWAY: Find a way to destroy that hub. Let's take a walk. [Corridor] JANEWAY: I want to know why you didn't tell me about this. ADMIRAL: Because I remember how stubborn and self-righteous I used to be. I figured you might try to do something stupid. JANEWAY: We have an opportunity to deal a crippling blow to the Borg. It could save millions of lives. ADMIRAL: I didn't spend the last ten years looking for a way to get this crew home earlier so you could throw it all away on some intergalactic goodwill mission. JANEWAY: Maybe we should go back to Sickbay. ADMIRAL: Why, so you can have me sedated? JANEWAY: So I can have the Doctor reconfirm your identity. I refuse to believe I'll ever become as cynical as you. ADMIRAL: Am I the only one experiencing déjà vu here? JANEWAY: What are you talking about? ADMIRAL: Seven years ago you had the chance to use the Caretaker's array to get Voyager home. Instead you destroyed it. JANEWAY: I did what I knew was right. ADMIRAL: You chose to put the lives of strangers ahead of the lives of your crew. You can't make the same mistake again. JANEWAY: You got Voyager home, which means I will too. If it takes a few more years then that's ADMIRAL: Seven of Nine is going to die. JANEWAY: What? ADMIRAL: Three years from now she'll be injured on an away mission. She'll make it back to Voyager, and die in the arms of her husband. JANEWAY: Husband? ADMIRAL: Chakotay. He'll never be the same after Seven's death, and neither will you. JANEWAY: If I know what's going to happen I can avoid it. ADMIRAL: Seven isn't the only one. Between this day and the day I got Voyager home, I lost twenty two crew members. And then of course there's Tuvok. JANEWAY: What about him? ADMIRAL: You're forgetting the Temporal Prime Directive, Captain. JANEWAY: The hell with it. ADMIRAL: Fine. Tuvok has a degenerative neurological condition that he hasn't told you about. There's a cure in the Alpha quadrant but if he doesn't get it in time. Even if you alter Voyager's route, limit your contact with alien species, you're going to lose people, but I'm offering you a chance to get all of them home safe and sound today. Are you really going to walk away from that? [Ready room] TUVOK: Your concern is appreciated, Captain, but premature. It will be several years before the symptoms become serious. Until then, the Doctor can manage my condition with medication. JANEWAY: Is it true what the Admiral said, that there's a cure in the Alpha quadrant? TUVOK: It is called a fal-tor-voh, and it requires a mind meld with another Vulcan. JANEWAY: What about the other Vulcans on Voyager? TUVOK: None of them are compatible. JANEWAY: But members of your family are. If you knew that returning to the Alpha Quadrant was your only chance for recovery, why didn't you object when I asked you to help find a way to destroy the hub? TUVOK: My sense of logic isn't impaired yet. If we succeed, millions of lives will be saved. JANEWAY: What about your life? TUVOK: To quote Ambassador Spock, the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. [Cargo Bay two] SEVEN: I appreciate your candour, Admiral, but Captain Janeway is my commanding officer. I won't disobey her. ADMIRAL: I'm not asking you to. I simply want you to tell her that in your opinion, destroying the hub is too risky, the cost too high. SEVEN: I can't do that. ADMIRAL: Even if it means avoiding the consequences I mentioned? SEVEN: Now that I know about those consequences they are no longer a certainty, but even if they were, my death would be a small price to pay for the destruction of the transwarp network. ADMIRAL: I have known you for a long time, Seven, longer than you've known yourself. You are thinking that collapsing the network is an opportunity to atone for atrocities you participated in while you were a drone. It's time to let go of the past and start thinking about your future. SEVEN: My future is insignificant compared to the lives of the people we'd be saving. ADMIRAL: You're being selfish. SEVEN: Selfish? I'm talking about helping others. ADMIRAL: Strangers in a hypothetical scenario. I'm talking about real life. Your colleagues, your friends, people who love you. Imagine the impact your death would have on them. SEVEN: Excuse me, Admiral, I have work to complete. [Briefing room] TUVOK: Once inside, we'd fire a spread of transphasic torpedoes. SEVEN: They'd be programmed to detonate simultaneously. TUVOK: If the torpedoes penetrate the shielding, the conduits should begin to collapse in a cascade reaction. In order to avoid the shock wave, we'd have less than ten seconds to exit the hub. JANEWAY: A long time ago, I made a decision that stranded this crew in the Delta quadrant. I don't regret that decision, but I didn't know all of you then and Voyager was just a starship. It's much more than that now. It's become our home. I know I could order you to carry out this plan and none of you would hesitate for a second, but I'm not going to do that. You know the crewmen who work under you, and you know what your own hearts are telling you. So we're not going to attempt this unless everyone in this room agrees. No one will think less of you if you don't. KIM: Captain. JANEWAY: Go ahead, Harry. KIM: I think it's safe to say that no one on this crew has been more obsessed with getting home than I have but. when I think about everything we've been through together, maybe it's not the destination that matters, maybe it's the journey. If that journey takes a little longer so we can do something we all believe in, I can't think of anyplace I'd rather be or any people I'd rather be with. PARIS: To the journey. CHAKOTAY: Here, here. ALL: To the journey! Hear, Hear. (all raise coffee mugs in salute while the Admiral glowers at their backs) [Mess hall] ADMIRAL: Coffee, black. JANEWAY: I thought you gave it up. ADMIRAL: I've decided to revive a few of my old habits. JANEWAY: Oh? What else besides the coffee? ADMIRAL: Oh well, I used to be much more idealistic. I took a lot of risks. I'd been so determined to get this crew home for so many years that I think I forgot how much they loved being together, and how loyal they were to you. It's taken me a few days to realise it. This is your ship, your crew, not mine. I was wrong to lie to you, To think I could talk you out of something you'd set your mind to. JANEWAY: You were only trying to do what you thought was right for all of us. ADMIRAL: Well you've changed my mind about that, and I'd like to help you carry out your mission. Maybe together we can increase our odds. JANEWAY: Maybe we can do more than that. There's got to be a way to have our cake and eat it too. ADMIRAL: We can't destroy the hub and get Voyager home. JANEWAY: Are you absolutely sure about that? ADMIRAL: There might be a way. I considered it once, but it seemed too risky. JANEWAY: That was before you decided to revive your old habits. ADMIRAL: I don't know why I ever gave this up. [Admiral Janeway's shuttle] ADMIRAL: It's about time. I'm not getting any younger, you know. JANEWAY: You're sure you want to do this? ADMIRAL: No, but Voyager isn't big enough for both of us. JANEWAY: (injects her) Good luck, Admiral. ADMIRAL: You, too. Captain, I'm glad I got to know you again. [Astrometrics lab] CHAKOTAY: Any word from the Admiral? SEVEN: We lost contact as soon as she entered the hub. CHAKOTAY: Did the Borg give her any trouble? SEVEN: Her vessel was scanned by several cubes, but none approached her, sir. CHAKOTAY: Are we keeping things professional again today? SEVEN: Yes, Commander. CHAKOTAY: You're not joking, are you. SEVEN: No. CHAKOTAY: What's wrong? SEVEN: Nothing. I'm just busy. CHAKOTAY: I think I've gotten to know you a little better than that. SEVEN: I'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me as though we're on intimate terms. CHAKOTAY: We are on intimate terms. SEVEN: Not anymore. CHAKOTAY: What the hell is going on? SEVEN: I've decided to alter the parameters of our relationship. CHAKOTAY: You mind telling me why? SEVEN: We both have dangerous occupations. It's possible one of us could be seriously injured, or worse. I believe it's best to avoid emotional attachments. CHAKOTAY: Maybe you can just flip some Borg switch and shut down your emotions, but I can't. SEVEN: I suggest you try. It will make things less difficult for you if any harm should come to me. CHAKOTAY: Why are you suddenly so concerned about that? Is there something I should know? SEVEN: The Admiral suggested that your feelings for me will cause you pain in the future. I can't allow that to happen. CHAKOTAY: Seven, any relationship involves risk and nobody can guarantee what's going to happen tomorrow. not even an Admiral from the future. The only certainty is how we feel about each other here and now. If you think I'm going to let you end this because of what might happen, then you need to get to know me a little better. [Sickbay] EMH: Try to relax, Lieutenant. TORRES: (groaning) If you tell me to relax one more time I'm going to rip your holographic head off. EMH: I hope you don't intend to kiss your baby with that mouth. PARIS: Tell me this isn't another false alarm. EMH: This isn't another false alarm. PARIS: I can't believe it. TORRES: Oh, believe it! PARIS: I might actually win! TORRES: What? PARIS: The baby pool. I picked today, fifteen hundred hours. TORRES: I'm so glad I could accommodate you! EMH: Don't celebrate yet. Klingon labour sometimes lasts several days. (Torres screams) Of course, I'm sure that won't be the case here. ! JANEWAY [OC]: Bridge to Lieutenant Paris. We're ready to get underway. PARIS: Captain, I'm afraid TORRES: Go. PARIS: But TORRES: No buts, Flyboy. If this mission is going to succeed we need our best pilot at the helm. Don't worry, the Doctor will be here with me. JANEWAY [OC]: Is there a problem, Mister Paris? PARIS: On my way, Captain. TORRES: Let's get this show on the road. [Borg Queen's chamber] BORG [OC]: Voyager has altered course. Current position spatial grid three six two, trajectory one one two mark five. ADMIRAL: I don't know how you do it. All those voices talking at once. You must get terrible headaches. If you're calling drones to assimilate me, don't bother. QUEEN: I don't need drones to assimilate you. ADMIRAL: I'm not actually here, your Majesty, I'm in your mind. I'm [Admiral Janeway's shuttle] ADMIRAL: using a synaptic interface. If I were you, I wouldn't waste my time trying to trace the signal. [Borg Queen's chamber] ADMIRAL: For the moment, it's beyond your abilities. QUEEN: What do you want? ADMIRAL: To make a deal. Captain Janeway thinks I'm here to help her destroy your transwarp network. QUEEN: That's beyond your ability. ADMIRAL: Oh I know that, and I tried to explain it to my naive, younger self, but she wouldn't listen. She's determined to bring down that hub. QUEEN: She'll fail. ADMIRAL: Yes, but she has weapons that I brought from the future. I believe you're familiar with them. QUEEN: Transphasic torpedoes. We will adapt. ADMIRAL: Eventually, but not before Voyager does a great deal of damage. I'm willing to tell you how to adapt to those weapons now. QUEEN: In exchange for what? ADMIRAL: Send a cube to tractor Voyager and drag them back to the Alpha quadrant. QUEEN: You're asking me to believe that the incorruptible Kathryn Janeway would betray her own crew. ADMIRAL: Not betray them, save them from themselves. I brought technology to help Voyager get home but the Captain's arrogant, self-righteous, and her officers are so blinded by loyalty that they're prepared to sacrifice their lives just to deal a crippling blow to the Borg. QUEEN: But you'd never try to harm us. ADMIRAL: I've become a pragmatist in my old age. All I want is to get that crew back to their families. QUEEN: You wish to ensure the well-being of your Collective. I can appreciate that. I'll help you but it'll cost more than you're offering. ADMIRAL: What do you want? QUEEN: Your vessel and its database. ADMIRAL: I told you, I'll show you how to adapt to their torpedoes. QUEEN: Insufficient. ADMIRAL: If I let you assimilate technology from the future, there's no telling how events would be altered. QUEEN: You're willing to alter the future by getting Voyager home now. ADMIRAL: Oh yes, but there's a difference. QUEEN: Do what all good pragmatists do, Admiral, compromise. ADMIRAL: All right. I'll give you the shuttle after Voyager arrives safely in the Alpha quadrant. QUEEN: You've already lied to your younger self. How do I know you're not lying to me? ADMIRAL: I guess you'll just have to trust me. QUEEN: That won't be necessary. You underestimate me, Admiral. While we've been talking, my drones have triangulated your signal. [Admiral Janeway's shuttle] ADMIRAL: Computer, deactivate the interface. Deploy armour. [Borg Queen's chamber] QUEEN: (beams Janeway in) Very clever. Hiding right on my doorstep. Were you planning to attack us from inside the Unicomplex? Not feeling talkative? (assimilates her) You and I don't need words to understand each other. [Bridge] JANEWAY: Take us in. PARIS: Aye, Captain. [Borg Queen's chamber] BORG [OC]: Voyager has entered aperture eight two three, access transwarp corridor zero nine. Redirect vessels to intercept at subjunction (Queen gets an electric shock, voice becomes garbled) ADMIRAL: Must be something you assimilated. QUEEN: What have you done? ADMIRAL: I thought we didn't need words to understand each other. QUEEN: You've infected us with an neurolytic pathogen. ADMIRAL: Just enough to bring chaos to order. [Bridge] SEVEN: The Admiral succeeded, Captain. The conduit's shielding is destabilising. JANEWAY: Now, Mister Tuvok. (fires torpedoes) [Borg Queen's chamber] QUEEN: Voyager will be destroyed. ADMIRAL: They're ahead of the shock wave. They'll survive. Captain Janeway and I made sure of that. It's you who underestimated us. QUEEN: (pulls off a disintegrating arm) Sphere six three four. They can still hear my thoughts. I may have assimilated your pathogen but I also assimilated your armour technology. (leg falls off) Captain Janeway is about to die. If she has no future, you will never exist and nothing that you've done here today will happen. (Queen dies, central complex explodes) [Starfleet Command] ADMIRAL PARIS: What the hell is it? BARCLAY: A transwarp aperture. It's less than a light year from Earth. OFFICER: How many Borg vessels? BARCLAY: We can't get a clear reading, but the graviton emissions are off the scale. ADMIRAL PARIS: I want every ship in range to converge on those co-ordinates now. CREWWOMAN: Yes, sir. [Bridge] (a sphere is chasing Voyager, firing constantly) TUVOK: Aft armour is down to six percent. KIM: Hull breaches on decks six through twelve. PARIS: I can't stay ahead of them, Captain. TUVOK: The armour is failing. CHAKOTAY: Where's the nearest aperture? SEVEN: Approximately thirty seconds ahead, but it leads back to the Delta quadrant. JANEWAY: Mister Paris, prepare to adjust your heading. PARIS: Yes, ma'am. [Starfleet Command] OFFICER: We've got eighteen ships in position, Nine more on the way. ADMIRAL PARIS: Open a channel. BARCLAY: Open, sir. ADMIRAL PARIS: This is Admiral Paris. Use all necessary force. I repeat, all necessary force. BARCLAY: Sir, there's a vessel coming through. [Bridge] JANEWAY: Mister Paris, what's our position? PARIS: Right where we expect it to be. SEVEN: The transwarp network has been obliterated, Captain. JANEWAY: We'll celebrate later. Mister Tuvok? (torpedoes are fired, the sphere explodes from inside out) [Starfleet Command] ADMIRAL PARIS: Cease fire! (Voyager streaks out of the fireball towards the Starfleet ships) [Bridge] JANEWAY: We did it. KIM: We're being hailed. JANEWAY: On screen. Sorry to surprise you. Next time, we'll call ahead. ADMIRAL PARIS [on viewscreen]: Welcome back. JANEWAY: It's good to be here. ADMIRAL PARIS [on viewscreen]: How did you? JANEWAY: It'll all be in my report, sir. ADMIRAL PARIS [on viewscreen]: I look forward to it. JANEWAY: Thanks for your help, Admiral Janeway. EMH [OC]: Sickbay to the Bridge. (baby crying in background. Kim chuckles) [Sickbay] EMH: Doctor to Lieutenant Paris. There's someone here who'd like to say hello. [Bridge] JANEWAY: You'd better get down there, Tom. PARIS: Yes, ma'am. JANEWAY: Mister Chakotay, the helm. CHAKOTAY: Aye, Captain. JANEWAY: Set a course, for home. Star Trek ® is copyright of CBS Studios INC.

       "\"Title: Threshold Stardate: 49373.4 Original Airdate: January 29 1996 [Shuttlecraft] PARIS: Warp five. Warp six. Warp seven. I've reached critical velocity. TORRES [OC]: Okay. Everything looks good on this end. Fire up the new engines. PARIS: Acknowledged. Engaging transwarp drive in four, three, two... Transwarp on-line. Warp nine point two, nine point three. My vector's drifting. KIM [OC]: Try to stabilise your field symmetry. PARIS: Got it. Warp nine point six, nine point seven. I'm reading a fracture in the port nacelle pylon. TORRES [OC]: Full power to structural integrity. PARIS: Warp nine point nine, nine point nine five. I'm approaching the threshold. But the nacelle isn't holding! KIM [OC]: Tie in auxiliary power! PARIS: It's no use. I'm breaking up! I'm breaking TORRES: You're dead. [Mess Hall] TORRES: It's the pylon again. Every time we get close to crossing the threshold, the subspace torque rips a nacelle off the shuttle. KIM: What about a duranium alloy? We could try using it to reinforce TORRES: No, I've thought about that already. It's too brittle. NEELIX: More coffee? Ah. You look like a happy bunch. KIM: We've hit a wall. NEELIX: Oh. Well, maybe I can help. PARIS: Great. Do you know anything about quantum warp theory or multi-spectral subspace engine design? NEELIX: No. But I'm a quick study. What are we working on? TORRES: Do you have anything to eat? NEELIX: Uh, sure. There's some Kalavian biscuits, uh, somewhere in the kitchen. TORRES: I guess I'll go find them myself. Fill him in. KIM: Neelix, it would take too long to NEELIX: What are you saying? I'm not smart enough? I'll have you know I did two years as an engineer's assistant aboard a Trabalian freighter. I'm well-versed in warp theory. PARIS: Okay, okay. We'll tell you. We're trying to break the maximum warp barrier. KIM: Nothing in the universe can go warp ten. It's a theoretical impossibility. In principle, if you were ever to reach warp ten, you'd be travelling at infinite velocity. NEELIX: Infinite velocity. Got it. So tha-that means very fast. PARIS: It means that you would occupy every point in the universe simultaneously. In theory, you could go any place in the wink of an eye. Time and distance would have no meaning. KIM: If Voyager achieved warp ten, we could be home in as long as it takes to push a button. NEELIX: Wow! And you're working on this? PARIS: We discovered a new form of dilithium in the asteroid field we surveyed last month. It remains stable at a much higher warp frequency. KIM: The problem is, every time we simulate crossing the transwarp threshold, the nacelles get torn off the ship. NEELIX: I remember there was a time when I lost a warp nacelle going through a dark matter nebula. PARIS: This is a very different problem. NEELIX: I realise that. I'm just using it as an example. As the ship went through the nebula, it sent out a dark matter bow wave. Eventually, so much pressure built up, it tore the nacelle from its housing. Now, maybe the same thing is happening to you. KIM: No, the simulations don't indicate any kind of subspace stress on the nacelles. PARIS: Wait a minute. What about the shuttle itself? KIM: What do you mean? PARIS: Maybe we've been looking in the wrong place. What if the nacelles aren't being torn from the ship? What if the ship is being torn from the nacelles? KIM: The hull of the shuttle is made of tritanium alloy. At the speeds we're talking about, that alloy could depolarise. PARIS: And create a velocity differential. The fuselage would be travelling at a faster rate of speed than the nacelles. KIM: That means we just have to set up a depolarisation matrix around the fuselage. PARIS: That's it! Neelix, you're a genius. NEELIX: I have no idea what they just said. [Conference Room] PARIS [on monitor]: Warp nine point nine two. The pylons are secure. Everything looks good. Nine point nine seven, eight, nine. Warp ten! TORRES [OC]: You've crossed the threshold. You've done it. And there's been no damage to the nacelles. JANEWAY: When you came to me a month ago and said you had a way to cross the transwarp threshold, I thought it was more of a fantasy than a theory. Congratulations to all of you. TORRES: So we can try a manned test flight? JANEWAY: What's your flight plan? PARIS: I'll bring the shuttle up to speed. The second I cross the threshold, I'll cut the engines, drop out of warp and come about. KIM: After that, we'll analyse the shuttle's sensor logs. Once we know it's safe to travel at transwarp, we'll try a more extended flight. CHAKOTAY: To be honest, it's almost frightening. Up till now, it's all been theory. I never thought it would actually happen. Are we ready for it? JANEWAY: In the last couple of centuries, we've always managed to use new technologies wisely. I'm confident this time won't be any different. Besides, there's no way to put the genie back in the bottle. All we can do now is keep moving forward, carefully. Well, good luck Mister Paris. If this works, you'll be joining an elite group of pilots. Orville Wright, Neil Armstrong, Zefram Cochrane and Tom Paris. PARIS: I kind of like the way that sounds. JANEWAY: I thought you might. [Paris's Quarters] PARIS: Come in. Captain! I, er JANEWAY: At ease, Mister Paris. I know it's late. PARIS: Can I get you anything? JANEWAY: No, thank you. PARIS: Now, why do I get the feeling this isn't just a social call? JANEWAY: I've just spoken to the Doctor, and it's his opinion that we let Ensign Kim make the test flight. PARIS: May I ask why? JANEWAY: He checked over your biometric readings from the shuttle simulations. He says you have a slight enzymatic imbalance in your cerebellum. PARIS: So? JANEWAY: I know it doesn't sound like much, but he can't predict what'll happen when you cross the threshold. He believes there's a small chance that you could suffer a brain haemorrhage under the subspace stress. PARIS: How big a chance? JANEWAY: Two percent. PARIS: Two percent? I'll take that chance. JANEWAY: There's no reason to. Ensign Kim is capable of piloting the shuttle for this mission. PARIS: Yeah, he's capable. That's not the point. JANEWAY: What is the point, Mister Paris? PARIS: Well, it's hard to explain but this is my flight. JANEWAY: Your flight? PARIS: When I was a boy, my father used to tell me that I was special, that one day I'd do something significant. My teachers at school, all the kids, everyone used to say 'Tom Paris is going to do something important when he grows up.' Obviously, that didn't happen. JANEWAY: This isn't about personal redemption. We're talking about medical risk. Your life could be in danger, and we need you. PARIS: Captain, this is the first time in ten years I feel I have a life to risk. JANEWAY: You're sure about this? PARIS: Captain, I've never been so sure about anything. Please. Please let me make the flight. JANEWAY: Good luck Lieutenant. [Engineering] TORRES: Torres to Bridge. The pre-launch sequence is complete, Captain. [Bridge] JANEWAY: Acknowledged. Ensign Kim, depressurise the shuttle bay and open the space doors. KIM: Aye, Captain. JANEWAY: Bridge to Shuttlecraft Cochrane. You're cleared for launch. PARIS [OC]: Aye, Captain. [Shuttlecraft Cochrane] PARIS: See you at warp ten. PARIS: Cochrane to Voyager. All systems are nominal. I'm increasing speed. JANEWAY [OC]: We'll keep up with you as long as we can. PARIS: Warp seven, warp eight... [Engineering] TORRES: How's his dilithium matrix holding up? PARIS [OC]: Warp nine. JONAS: There's a slight variance in the warp field, but nothing to worry about. TORRES: Okay. Torres to shuttlecraft Cochrane. You're clear for transwarp velocity. [Shuttlecraft Cochrane] PARIS: Acknowledged. Engaging transwarp drive in four, three, two... [Bridge] PARIS [OC]: Warp nine point seven, nine point eight, nine point nine. TUVOK: He's exceeding our maximum velocity. I'm switching to long-range sensors. PARIS [OC]: Warp nine point nine five! TUVOK: He is approaching the threshold. [Shuttlecraft Cochrane] PARIS: Engine output at maximum. Velocity, warp ten. [Bridge] KIM: Yes! PARIS [OC]: Transwarp engines are stable. So are the nacelle pylons. I'm going to JANEWAY: Lieutenant, can you hear me? KIM: Captain, he just disappeared off sensors. CHAKOTAY: Increase sensor gain to maximum. KIM: Nothing. I can't find him. He's gone. KIM: I've done three full sensor sweeps. No sign of the shuttle within five parsecs. JANEWAY: Tuvok, could the shuttle have been destroyed? TUVOK: I don't believe so. Sensors indicate that he did cross the warp threshold. KIM: If that's true, then he could be anywhere in the universe. JANEWAY: We'll just have to keep searching our small corner. Run a multispectral sweep. I want to see if TUVOK: Captain, there's a quantum surge off the port bow. Something is coming out of subspace. JANEWAY: Janeway to Paris. KIM: He's alive. But his life signs are weak. JANEWAY: Bridge to Transporter Room Two. Beam Mister Paris directly to Sickbay. Commander, bring the shuttle aboard. I'll be in Sickbay. CHAKOTAY: Aye, Captain. [Sickbay] EMH: His life signs are normal. A few elevated serotonin readings in the hypothalamus. From what I can tell, he's just asleep. JANEWAY: Can you wake him? EMH: I don't see why not. Wake up, Lieutenant! JANEWAY: Are you all right, Tom? PARIS: I'm back. JANEWAY: We tracked you until you crossed the threshold. Then you disappeared from our sensors. Do you remember what happened? PARIS: Oh, yeah. I was, I was staring at the velocity indicator. It said warp 10. And then, as I watched it, I suddenly realised that I was watching myself as well. I could see the outside of the shuttle. I-I could see Voyager. I could see inside Voyager. I could see inside this room. For a moment, I was everywhere. I mean everywhere, Captain. With the Kazon, back home, with the Klingons, other galaxies. It was all there. I don't know how else to explain it. It was like... Well, no, it wasn't like anything. EMH: Well, I'm glad you had a good time. JANEWAY: How did you get back to Voyager? PARIS: I saw that you were looking for me, so I took the new engines off-line and ended up back where I started. But it's starting to slip away. It all was so vivid, and now... TORRES: Tom! PARIS: Oh, I'm fine. How's the shuttle? TORRES: You brought it back without a scratch. The on-board sensors confirm that you did it. You made it to warp 10. JANEWAY: Congratulations, Mister Paris. You've just made the history books. PARIS: We should download the shuttle's sensor logs, analyse the telemetry they picked up during the flight before we make another attempt. EMH: You're not going anywhere. At least not for a few hours. I have some tests I'd like to run on Your Majesty before I release you back into the realm of ordinary humans. PARIS: You may proceed. JANEWAY: We'll download the logs. I'll let you know what we find. [Engineering] JANEWAY: Janeway to Kim. We're ready. [Shuttlecraft Cochrane] KIM: Acknowledged. I'm downloading the logs into the engineering computer core. [Engineering] TORRES: This data describes literally every cubic centimetre in this sector. It's over five billion gigaquads of information. JANEWAY: It would appear that the theory of infinite velocity is correct. It may be possible to occupy every point in the universe simultaneously. TORRES: Then it's just a matter of navigation. If we could figure out how to come out of transwarp at a specific point, this could get us home. JANEWAY: It could do more than that. It could change the very nature of our existence. Think of it. There would be nothing beyond our reach. This telemetry is giving us an invaluable record of this sector. We can use it to make a star chart. Transfer the shuttle logs to Stellar Cartography for analysis. TORRES: Right. [Mess Hall] NEELIX: This is a new blend. I'm calling it 'Paris Delight'. It's in honour of you. PARIS: What? Oh! Oh, thanks. That's very flattering. NEELIX: I can tell. TORRES: Well, you might as well get used to it. You're a hero now. PARIS: I wish I could say it was nothing. Oh, Oh! I wish Neelix would name something after me that tasted a little better. TORRES: Smells okay. PARIS: No, trust me. You're taking your life into your hands. So, I think the next step is to try to duplicate the first shuttle flight, verify our results. TORRES: I agree. We have to confirm that none of this was a fluke. PARIS: But I do think that we should increase the shuttle's memory core by at least TORRES: What? What's wrong? PARIS: I don't think that coffee is settling too well. TORRES: Do you want to go back to Sickbay? PARIS: No! No. I've seen enough of the Doctor for one day. Oh! On second thought, maybe I should... TORRES: Torres to Transporter Room Two! Medical emergency! Beam Lieutenant Paris directly to Sickbay. CREWMAN [OC]: I can't lock onto him. His pattern keeps changing. TORRES: Torres to Sickbay. We need a medical team in the Mess Hall right away! Hang on, Tom. [Sickbay] EMH: Hmm, it looks like he's having an allergic reaction. What did he ingest? TORRES: Just a cup of Neelix's coffee. EMH: It's a miracle he's still alive. This is strange. TORRES: What is? EMH: He's definitely having an allergic reaction to the water in the coffee. TORRES: He's allergic to water? EMH: I don't know how this is possible, but it appears that his entire biochemistry is changing. His electrolytes are breaking down, interstitial fluids are congealing. The alveoli in his lungs are mutating. He's no longer processing oxygen. TORRES: What should we do? EMH: Stand back. Computer, erect an isolation field around the surgical bay. Computer, remove all the air from within the force field and replace it with 80percent nitrogen and 20percent acidichloride. He can breath, for now. TORRES: What's happening to him? EMH: I have no idea, but I assume it had something to do with his experience on the shuttle. His cellular membranes are deteriorating. He's dying. I need to know more about what happened on that shuttle, and I need to know it now! Radiation levels, unexplained anomalies, anything. PARIS: You're losing me, aren't you? I'm going to die. EMH: You're too stubborn to die, Mister Paris. I want to try a high saturation radiometric therapy. It might slow down his cellular mutation. PARIS: Here lies Thomas Eugene Paris, beloved mutant. EMH: A fitting epitaph, but I don't intend to let you use it just yet. KES: Radiometric emitters are charged and ready. EMH: Begin with forty five rads per second. PARIS: Great. Now it'll read, 'Beloved radioactive mutant'. EMH: No effect. Increase the dosage to eighty five rads per second. I'm going to try inhibiting the cell mitosis with a bio-suppresser field. PARIS: Big funeral with lots of pretty girls all crying. Except Torres. Torres doesn't cry. Did you ever notice that? I don't trust people who don't cry. Of course, my father, he'd say crying is a sign of weakness. I never believed that. Do you cry? EMH: It's not in my programme. PARIS: Shame. You know, it's funny. What I remember most about being a kid are the times I spent in my room crying. I liked my room though. It was quiet in there. People would leave me alone. I'd keep the door locked, read, play games. I lost my virginity in that room. Seventeen. Parents were away for the weekend. EMH: I'll note that in your medical file. PARIS: Oh! EMH: His lymphatic system is collapsing. Increase dosage to ninety eight rads per second. PARIS: Pepperoni! God, I'd love a pepperoni pizza with Kavarian olives right now. I'm starving! EMH: His life signs are critical. Maximum dosage. PARIS: Kiss me. EMH: What? PARIS: Not you. Her. EMH: She can't breathe the atmosphere in here. PARIS: Consider it a last request. KES: I'm sorry, Tom. If we let down the force field, you'll suffocate. PARIS: Oh, what's the difference? I'm dying anyway. Do me a favour. When I'm gone, call Starfleet Headquarters and tell Dad that I did it. Tell him. EMH: Prepare to activate the neural stimulator. KES: Ready. EMH: Now! Again. Again! No neural activity. KES: We can try to revive him. EMH: His cell membranes have degraded. There's nothing more we can do. Computer, remove the acidichloride gas from the isolation field and deactivate the field. It will be necessary for us to perform an autopsy on the Lieutenant's body in the morning. Until then, I suggest you get some rest. EMH: You're alive! PARIS: What's happening? EMH: All of your internal organs are functioning again. In fact, you seem to have an extra one. PARIS: What? EMH: You have two hearts. [Somewhere on Voyager] JONAS: I have thirty seconds before Security picks up this transmission. I'm sending you all current information on the warp ten shuttle flight. RETTICK [on monitor]: Warp ten? That's impossible. JONAS: Not anymore. Lieutenant Paris crossed the threshold this morning. RETTICK [on monitor]: He survived? JONAS: In a matter of speaking. It's all in the file. This should prove my worth to you, Rettick. RETTICK [on monitor]: We'll see. [Sickbay] EMH: He's body is going through some sort of mutation. His DNA is rewriting itself. To what end, I don't know. JANEWAY: Does this have anything to do with the enzymatic imbalance you found? EMH: No. JANEWAY: Can you stop it? EMH: So far, nothing has worked. The mutations are unlike anything in Starfleet medical records. His internal organs are being rearranged. Some have atrophied and been absorbed into his body, and there are at least three others that have appeared and have no identifiable function at all. JANEWAY: What about his brain? EMH: There are neuroelectrical transmutations at work. His synaptic patterns are changing almost every second. But he does still recognise me, the ship. He knows who he is. JANEWAY: Can I talk to him? EMH: Of course. But I feel I should caution you that while he still is Tom Paris, he's becoming something else as well. His personality is erratic, unpredictable. There are moments of lucidity interspersed with almost deranged behaviour. JANEWAY: I'll keep it in mind. PARIS: Pretty disgusting, huh? JANEWAY: You've looked better. How do you feel? PARIS: Like a lab experiment gone wrong. JANEWAY: Well, we're trying to put that experiment right. The Doctor's working on a way to restore your DNA to its original PARIS: Why? JANEWAY: Excuse me? PARIS: Why? What I'm becoming will probably be better than who I was. JANEWAY: Lieutenant, you know that's not true. PARIS: Oh, yes, it is. Admit it. Part of you will be glad to see me gone. I'm the Maquis traitor who sits on your Bridge and insults your uniform, remember? JANEWAY: We're all concerned about you, Tom. We're here to help you. PARIS: No, you're not. You're trying to take this away from me. JANEWAY: Take what away from you? PARIS: What I'm becoming. How do you know this isn't good for me? How do you know this isn't the best thing that's ever happened to me? JANEWAY: That's a possibility. And then again, it could kill you. We need to find out what's going on. PARIS: You're lying. Just like him. Just like everyone around here. Always lying. Always telling me that I'm doing a good job, that you're glad I'm on this ship. But none of that's true. Why can't you just say it? You're jealous that I broke the transwarp barrier, and now you're hoping I'll die! JANEWAY: You're right, Doctor. I don't think there's anything I can do here. PARIS: Wait, Captain. I'm sorry. Please come back. I know you're doing what you can. It's just I'm scared. I didn't mean to lash out at you. JANEWAY: What you're going through would scare any of us, but you have to hang on, Tom. We're doing everything we can to help you. PARIS: I know you are. And I know you'll fail! You know, I used to look up to you. But now you seem so small, so insignificant. You don't even know what, what, what KES: Doctor, the rate of genetic mutation has accelerated by twelve percent. EMH: I want you to run a nucleogenic scan to determine how much of his original DNA is left intact. In the meantime, I'm going to see about treating him with PARIS: Doctor! EMH: What is it now, Mister Paris? PARIS: I need to talk. EMH: So I've noticed. Is it urgent? I'm rather busy right now. PARIS: Urgent. Yes, urgent. Let me out of here. EMH: I'm afraid that's not possible. PARIS: Please. I can't stay here. I have to get off this ship. KES: Leave Voyager? Why? PARIS: I understand. It's all so clear now. EMH: What do you understand? PARIS: The present, the past, they're both in the future. The future is in the past. EMH: I beg your pardon? PARIS: Listen to me! I am more. I'm everything. Let me go. KES: Go where, Tom? PARIS: I can't! Please! Please! EMH: Something tells me we'd better hurry. [Briefing Room] EMH [on monitor]: I believe the answer lies in forcing his DNA to revert to its original coding. Once that occurs, his body should return to its former state. CHAKOTAY: How do we do that? EMH [on monitor]: We destroy all of the new DNA in his body. His cells will have to use the original coding as a blueprint. But the only way to destroy the mutant DNA is with highly focused anti-proton radiation. TORRES: Anti-protons? The only place on this ship which generates anti-protons is the warp core. EMH [on monitor]: Exactly. I'd like to place Mister Paris in an isotopic restraint and then infuse it with controlled anti-proton bursts. A tricky venture, but I see no other alternative. TORRES: We'll have to take the warp core off-line, then I'll need about three hours to set up an interface. EMH [on monitor]: In three hours, there won't be anything left of Mister Paris to save. We have to make the attempt within an hour, at the most. JANEWAY: Get moving. [Engineering] EMH [on monitor]: What's your status, Lieutenant? TORRES: The interface is charged and ready. EMH [on monitor]: Infuse him with a two-second anti-proton burst. TORRES: Take the warp engines off-line. Bleed off point five seven AMUs of anti-proton radiation. Shunt it through the interface. JONAS: Transfer underway. [Sickbay] KES: Doctor, the mutated DNA in his liver cells has begun to deteriorate, but the original coding isn't taking over. EMH: I don't understand. This should be working. We'll have to increase the duration of the bursts. Lieutenant, prepare a five second burst. Also, you'll need to begin depolarising the TORRES [on monitor]: My God! EMH: Lieutenant? TORRES [on monitor]: Call Security! EMH: Lieutenant! What's happening? CREWMAN [OC]: I got him! I got him! Look over there! Shut it all down! TUVOK [OC]: This is a Level three Security Alert. All hands report to duty stations. [Corridor] JANEWAY: Janeway to Bridge. Report. CHAKOTAY [OC]: Paris broke out of confinement in Engineering. [Bridge] CHAKOTAY: He used a phaser on the port plasma conduit. We have power failures all over the ship. JANEWAY [OC]: Where is he now? CHAKOTAY: We're having trouble tracking him. We can't get power to the internal sensors. Tuvok has security teams searching deck by deck. [Corridor] JANEWAY: I'm on my way to the Bridge. [Bridge] KIM: Phaser discharge on Deck 6. CHAKOTAY: Localise it. KIM: I'm still having trouble with internal sensors. It came from somewhere between Sections twenty one and twenty seven alpha. CHAKOTAY: Tuvok doesn't have any security in that area. Chakotay to Tuvok. We think Paris may be on deck six. Deploy security to Sections 21 through 27 Alpha. KIM: Commander, someone's depressurising Shuttle Bay Two. CHAKOTAY: What? KIM: There's a launch in progress. CHAKOTAY: Tractor beam! KIM: It's offline. TUVOK [OC]: Tuvok to Bridge. We found the Captain's phaser on Deck 6, but there's no sign of her. CHAKOTAY: Maintain a sensor lock on that shuttle. KIM: I've got main power back. CHAKOTAY: Engage warp engines. Follow them. CREWWOMAN: Aye, Commander. KIM: They're approaching warp nine point nine. CHAKOTAY: Increase speed to match. COMPUTER: Warning. Nearing maximum warp velocity. Structural collapse is imminent. CHAKOTAY: Are we in tractor range? KIM: No. And they're still accelerating. Warp nine point nine seven. COMPUTER: Warning. At present speed, structural failure in forty five seconds. CHAKOTAY: Reduce sped to warp nine point five. Keep a sensor lock on them as long as you can. KIM: I've lost them, Commander. They've gone to transwarp. First Officer's Log, Stardate 49373.4. It's taken us three days to locate the shuttle. It appears to have dropped out of transwarp in an uninhabited star system. [Sickbay] EMH: I've re-examined the data on Mister Paris's transformation, and I think I understand what's happening to him. The mutations we observed are natural. CHAKOTAY: Natural? EMH: The changes in his DNA are consistent with the evolutionary development of the human genotype observed over the past four million years. Increased brain capacity. The loss of vestigial organs. TUVOK: Are you saying Lieutenant Paris is evolving? EMH: That's my theory. The only difference between natural evolution and what happened to Mister Paris is that his changes took place over a 24-hour period. Somehow, travelling at infinite velocity accelerated the natural human evolutionary process by millions of years. It's possible that Mister Paris represents a future stage in human development, although I can't say it's very attractive. CHAKOTAY: What do we do about it? EMH: I think my anti-proton approach was correct. However, I'll need to intensify the treatment to restore his original DNA. KIM [OC]: Bridge to Chakotay. CHAKOTAY: Go ahead. KIM [OC]: I think I've found the shuttlecraft, Commander. It's on the fourth planet in one of the jungles near the equator. CHAKOTAY: Acknowledged. Tuvok, have a security team meet us in Transporter Room Three. [Planet Surface] CHAKOTAY: There are traces of human DNA. It's them. But I have to admit, I'm not sure which one is the Captain. TUVOK: The female, obviously. CHAKOTAY: I don't know how I'm going to enter this into the log. TUVOK: I look forward to reading it. First Officer's Log, supplemental. We've transported the Captain and Mister Paris back to Sickbay. As for their offspring, I've decided to leave them in their new habitat. [Sickbay] EMH: I've eradicated all traces of the mutant DNA from your system and restored your original genome. Congratulations. You're human again. JANEWAY: Thank you, Doctor. EMH: Captain, it'll take some time for your genetic codes to stabilise. I'd like you to remain in Sickbay for the next three days, just to be safe. JANEWAY: Excuse me. PARIS: Captain, er JANEWAY: I've thought about having children, but I must say I never considered having them with you. PARIS: Captain, I'm sorry. I, I don't know what to say except I don't remember very much about, er, you know JANEWAY: What makes you think it was your idea? Sometimes it's the female of the species that initiates mating. But apology accepted, nonetheless. You may be interested to know I'm putting you in for a commendation. Regardless of the outcome, you did make the first transwarp flight. PARIS: Thank you, Captain. JANEWAY: Is there something wrong, Lieutenant? PARIS: I don't know. I guess this whole experience has left me feeling a little overwhelmed. Flying at warp ten, evolving into a new life form, mating, having alien offspring. JANEWAY: You've broken more than one record, that's for sure. PARIS: Breaking the threshold, it was incredible. But somehow it doesn't mean as much as I thought it would. JANEWAY: Oh? PARIS: I guess I went into this looking for a quick fix. I thought making history would change things, not just my service record, my reputation. JANEWAY: If I'm not mistaken, you've changed quite a few minds on this ship. You've earned a lot of people's respect and admiration. PARIS: Yeah. But I'm starting to realise that it's not other people's opinions I should be worried about. It's mine. It seems, Captain, that I still have a few barriers to break. I just hope they're not theoretical impossibilities. JANEWAY: Somehow, I don't think they will be.

       "\"Title: Equinox, Part 2 Stardate: Unknown Original Airdates: September 22, 1999 [Bridge] KIM: Fissures are opening, all decks! CHAKOTAY: Captain! JANEWAY: Give me tactical control. Good guess. I used a deflector pulse to reinforce the shields. It won't hold for long. PARIS: Bridge to Sickbay. We have a medical emergency. Doctor, respond. Ensign. ENSIGN: Yes, sir. KIM: Casualty reports are coming in. Two dead, thirteen wounded. We took heavy damage to the engines. JANEWAY: The Equinox? KIM: They've gone to warp. JANEWAY: Any sign of nucleogenic particles? KIM: No. JANEWAY: Then they haven't engaged their enhanced warp drive yet. Keep looking for. [Equinox Bridge] RANSOM: Report. BURKE: The shield grid is back in place. The aliens are staying clear. RANSOM: Are sensors picking up Voyager? LESSING: It looks like they're under attack. RANSOM: Maintain course. [Corridor] NEELIX: Captain, I found the Doctor's mobile emitter on deck nine. You might want to take it to Sickbay. [Sickbay] PARIS: Any sign of the Doc? JANEWAY: I've got him right here. E-EMH: Please state the nature of the. Don't bother. PARIS: You should start with Chakotay. I've got him stabilised but he's got internal injuries. JANEWAY: We found your emitter on deck nine. E-EMH: I was taken hostage by the Equinox crew. I deactivated myself to escape. Did you stop them? JANEWAY: No. CHAKOTAY: I'd ask for a status report but I'm not sure I'd want to hear it. JANEWAY: Harry's analysing the sound we've been hearing. He thinks it's some form of communication. CHAKOTAY: Well, I once figured out how to speak with a Terrelian seapod. This couldn't be that much harder, Once I get out of Sickbay, I'll lend him a hand. JANEWAY: We should all be focusing our efforts on finding the Equinox. CHAKOTAY: First things first. We've got to stop these attacks. JANEWAY: Our enemies aren't the aliens. They're the humans aboard the Equinox. It's crucial that you don't [Equinox - Ransom's Quarters] RANSOM: Who is it? BURKE [OC]: It's Max. I've brought you a visitor. RANSOM: Hold on. Come in. I'm glad you're okay. I've been using this synaptic stimulator. I was just taking a stroll along the Tenkaran coast. You're welcome to try it. SEVEN: State your intentions. RANSOM: You know, once we get our enhanced warp drive back online we'll be on our way home, but it'll still take months to get there. You can spend that time in the brig, or you can become part of this crew. I'd prefer the latter. SEVEN: I'd prefer the brig. RANSOM: You know, Janeway's not the only Captain who can help you explore your humanity. SEVEN: You would be an inferior role model. RANSOM: Janeway clung to her morality at the expense of her crew. Maybe you should learn from that mistake. SEVEN: Her only mistake was trusting you. RANSOM: Take care of her wound. [Equinox Sickbay] BURKE: First-degree phaser burns, minor lacerations. Looks like we'll have to amputate. That was a joke. You're supposed to smile and make a witty retort. SEVEN: I'm familiar with human banter. Yours is crude and predictable. BURKE: You know, Seven. Can I call you Seven? We don't have many luxuries around here. All we've got is each other. You might try letting your shields down or else it's going to be a lonely trip. I'll be damned, looks like our Doctor left us a replacement. EMH: Seven. SEVEN: We are captives. EMH: I was attacked by their EMH. BURKE: Looks like he downloaded you into our database. Good. You can treat your friend. [Equinox Engineering] THOMPSON: Priming the injectors. GILMORE: Marla to Bridge. RANSOM: Go ahead. GILMORE: We're ready. RANSOM [OC]: Acknowledged. [Equinox Bridge] RANSOM: Infuse the enhanced warp drive with twenty isograms of the compound. LESSING: Aye, sir. Warp drive ready. RANSOM: Engage. What happened? [Equinox Engineering] GILMORE: The power relays are offline. They've been encoded. [Equinox Sickbay] RANSOM: Give us the codes. SEVEN: No. BURKE: If she won't give us the codes maybe we could extract them ourselves. EMH: Seven's cranial infrastructure is highly complex. You'll need months just to figure out what she had for breakfast. BURKE: That's why you're going to help us. EMH: I refuse. BURKE: Do it or I'll erase your programme. EMH: Be my guest. SEVEN: Doctor. EMH: Don't worry, they need me. They'd be cutting off their holographic nose to spite their face. Now I suggest you. BURKE: All right, Doctor. Now, get to work. You know what we're looking for. EMH: Very well. She'll try to resist. I'll have to restrain her. SEVEN: Doctor. RANSOM: I deleted his ethical subroutines. He'll be a little more co-operative now. Keep me posted. EMH: Aye, Captain. This way, please. [Bridge] JANEWAY: It's not exactly Shakespeare, but it gets the point across. CHAKOTAY: A small olive branch is still an olive branch. JANEWAY: Run this through to your translation matrix. CHAKOTAY: Set your weapons down. PARIS: Commander? CHAKOTAY: Somebody's got to start trusting somebody around here. JANEWAY: Belay that order. I appreciate your optimism, but in this case, weapons. KIM: Ready to transmit. JANEWAY: Drop shields, Bridge only. Go ahead, Harry. Raise shields. KIM: If they understood our message, they haven't responded. JANEWAY: There's your response. Activate another deflector pulse. TUVOK: Shields are holding at sixty two percent. JANEWAY: That should buy us another few minutes of peace and quiet. I suggest we make the most of it. Focus your efforts on repairing the warp drive. We've got to find the Equinox. CHAKOTAY: If it's all the same to you I'd like to take another stab at the message. If we can reroute JANEWAY: They're not listening, Chakotay. We should be tracking Ransom, not tinkering with adverbs. [Ready room] CHAKOTAY: Want your first officer's advice? JANEWAY: Allow me. Our deflector's losing power, and when it fails, we'll be defenceless. It's Voyager we should be worrying about, not the Equinox. CHAKOTAY: You'd make a great first officer. It's advice worth taking. JANEWAY: Maybe so, but we have a crew member trapped on that ship. CHAKOTAY: Is this really about Seven, or is it about Ransom. JANEWAY: I don't know what you're talking about. CHAKOTAY: You've been known to hold a grudge. This man betrayed Starfleet, he broke the Prime Directive, dishonoured everything you believe in, and threw Voyager to the wolves. JANEWAY: Borg, Hirogen, Malon. We've run into our share of bad guys. Ransom's no different. CHAKOTAY: Yes, he is. You said it yourself. He's human. I don't blame you for being angry, but you can't compromise the safety of this ship to satisfy some personal vendetta. JANEWAY: I appreciate your candour. Now let me be just as blunt. You're right, I am angry. I'm damned angry. He's a Starfleet Captain, and he's decided to abandon everything this uniform stands for. He's out there right now…torturing and murdering innocent life-forms just to get home a little quicker. I'm not going to stand for it. I'm going to hunt him down no matter how long it takes, no matter what the cost. If you want to call that a vendetta, go right ahead. [Equinox Bridge] BURKE: Why did you bring us here? RANSOM: This planet has a parthogenic atmosphere. It will keep us from being detected while we make repairs. LESSING: We also found a few deuterium deposits. RANSOM: Take an away team, Noah, and see if you can localise the ore. BURKE: You won't be protected from the aliens. Arm yourselves with phasers. At the first sign of trouble, we'll beam you back. LESSING: Aye, sir. [Equinox Sickbay] EMH: The ocular node's connected to the sensory node. The sensory node's connected to the cortical node. The cortical node's connected to the reticular node. Don't look so gloomy. There's a silver lining to all this. Just think, we're finally going to see Earth. SEVEN: You are obviously delusional. Allow me to repair your programme. EMH: Now why would I want you to do that. You of all people should understand being unfettered by ethical subroutines has made me far more efficient. RANSOM: Status? EMH: I'm going to extract her cortical array. It contains an index of her memory engrams, but once I've removed it her higher brain functions, language, cognitive skills will be severely damaged. RANSOM: Tell me the codes. SEVEN: No. JANEWAY: Janeway was right about one thing. You are unique. It would be a shame to lose you. SEVEN: Your compassion is irrelevant. RANSOM: You think this is easy for me? The sight of you on that table, but you're leaving me no choice! SEVEN: No choice. You say that frequently. You destroy life-forms to attain your goals, then claim that they left you no choice. Does that logic comfort you? RANSOM: The codes. SEVEN: You'll have to destroy me to obtain them. EMH: The reticular node's connected to the occipital node. Captain's Log, supplemental. Our warp drive's back online, but repeated sensor sweeps have failed to locate the Equinox. [Ready room] JANEWAY: Come in. CHAKOTAY: You wanted to see me? JANEWAY: It's not like you to submit recommendations in writing. CHAKOTAY: The last time we spoke you weren't exactly receptive. JANEWAY: I'm afraid I'm not going to be very receptive this time, either. It's an interesting idea, but the Ankari are fifty light years in the wrong direction. CHAKOTAY: I understand that, but they're the ones who introduced Ransom to these life forms. It stands to reason they might be able to communicate with them, tell them to call off their attacks. JANEWAY: Our first priority is to find Ransom. Still no sign of nucleogenic particles? CHAKOTAY: Not yet. JANEWAY: Then he couldn't have gotten far. Without his enhanced drive his ship's only capable of warp six. I've been studying his service record. He's had his share of run-ins with hostile aliens. It seems that when he's being pursued he tends to hide. At Epsilon four he ran into a Klingon Bird-of-Prey, played a game of cat and mouse for three days in a nebula before the Klingons finally gave up. Two years later, he eluded a Romulan Warbird by taking his vessel into the atmosphere of a gas giant. Go to Astrometrics. Start looking for the kind of place you'd hide if your ship was damaged. CHAKOTAY: Yes, ma'am. [Equinox Bridge] GILMORE: How was the beach? RANSOM: Do these programs have people in them? GILMORE: No, just landscapes. Why? RANSOM: Forget it. [Planet surface] LESSING: I'm reading a vein of ore. Azimuth one seventeen, thirty metres. It could run pretty deep. We might need to use phasers to excavate it. Funny, this reminds me of McKinley Park. I used to take my sister there when we were kids. This place looks just like it. As I recall, there was a family of ground squirrels who lived right over there. There was a patch of poison ivy next to it. When I was ten, I walked right through it and I swelled up like a Rigellian bloodworm. When I get back to Earth the first thing I'm going to do is. CHAKOTAY: Four to beam up. [Equinox - Bridge] GILMORE: We're receiving a subspace transmission. RANSOM: From who? GILMORE: I can't tell. RANSOM: I don't see a ship out there. Open a channel. E-EMH: Doctor to Equinox. Respond. RANSOM: We can hear you. E-EMH: Voyager's found you. They've entered orbit. They polarised their hull to mask their approach. I believe they've planned an ambush on the away team. Janeway's been tracking the Equinox for a couple RANSOM: Get him back. GILMORE: I can't. RANSOM: Ransom to away team. Noah, prepare to beam back to the ship. GILMORE: They're not down there. RANSOM: All hands to battle stations! [Bridge] PARIS: Thirty thousand kilometres and closing. JANEWAY: Target their power core. [Equinox Bridge] GILMORE: Direct hit. Minor damage. RANSOM: Return fire. [Bridge] CHAKOTAY: Bridge to Torres. Status. [Astrometrics lab] TORRES: I can't locate their shield grid generator. Can you divert more power to sensors? [Bridge] CHAKOTAY: Stand by. TUVOK: They've damaged our deflector, Captain. If it goes offline we'll be vulnerable to the alien attacks. JANEWAY: Noted. Target his weapons array. [Equinox Bridge] GILMORE: We lost all phaser banks. RANSOM: Torpedoes, full spread. BURKE: It's B'Elanna. She's trying to bypass our security protocols. RANSOM: Stop her. [Astrometrics lab] TORRES: Computer, open a com-link to the Equinox. Workstation thirty three beta. [Equinox Bridge] TORRES [on monitor]: Max, listen to me. BURKE: Back for round two, BLT? TORRES [on monitor]: This isn't one of our games!. People are dying over here. BURKE: I wish you didn't have to be one of them. TORRES: Max, please. [Bridge] TUVOK: Shields are weakening, JANEWAY: We've almost got him. Keep targeting their weapons array. One more torpedo ought to do it. TUVOK: Captain. JANEWAY: Fire! [Equinox Bridge] GILMORE: Weapons are down! JANEWAY [OC]: Janeway to Ransom. Surrender your vessel. RANSOM: We still have thrusters, don't we? GILMORE: Aye, sir. RANSOM: Lay in a course through the planet's atmosphere. Sixty degree vector. [Bridge] JANEWAY: What the hell is he doing. Follow him! PARIS: Crossing the upper thermosphere. JANEWAY: Phasers. TUVOK: Shields are weakening. Thirty one percent, twenty nine. KIM: Inertial dampers are offline. CHAKOTAY: Captain, if we loose our shields well be attacked by the aliens. Captain! JANEWAY: Break off pursuit. [Equinox Bridge] GILMORE: They're retreating. RANSOM: Take us up! BURKE: They took heavy damage. Shields, propulsion. RANSOM: Get us out of here. [Bridge] PARIS: They've gone to warp. JANEWAY: Match their course and speed. KIM: We can't, not until we restore primary systems. JANEWAY: Time? KIM: We'll need a few hours. JANEWAY: At least we didn't come away empty-handed. [Cargo Bay two] JANEWAY: I want Ransom's tactical status. I want it now, Mister Lessing. LESSING: Or what, you'll hit me? JANEWAY: No, crewman. I'll drop the shields around this room and let your little friends come pay you a visit. LESSING: That would be murder. JANEWAY: You could also call it poetic justice. LESSING: I suppose the plan is that you're going to come to my rescue now, right? CHAKOTAY: There's no plan as far as I know. The Captain's on her own. JANEWAY: Ransom's status, now. LESSING: No way in hell. JANEWAY: We all make our own hell, Mister Lessing. I hope you enjoy yours. The comm. is active. We'll be outside if you have a change of heart. [Corridor] CHAKOTAY: What are you doing? JANEWAY: Weren't you listening? CHAKOTAY: Don't do this! JANEWAY: He'll break. [Bridge] TUVOK: Bridge to the Captain. We've lost shields in section twenty nine alpha. JANEWAY [OC]: I know. Stand by. [Corridor] CHAKOTAY: He's a loyal officer. He's not going to betray his Captain. Put up the shields! JANEWAY: He'll break. CHAKOTAY: Captain! JANEWAY: As you were. COMPUTER: Level nine authorisation required. CHAKOTAY: Damn it, Kathryn! JANEWAY: You're panicking. He's going to talk. [Bridge] TUVOK: Captain, a fissure is opening in that section. JANEWAY [OC]: Understood. [Corridor] CHAKOTAY: Okay, you've demonstrated your loyalty to your Captain. Fine. Now let's talk about the Ankari. [Briefing room] TORRES: If there's an Ankari vessel less than two light years from here, why haven't we detected it? CHAKOTAY: Apparently, they use a unique form of propulsion, which makes them very difficult to find. PARIS: You think they'll be willing to help us? CHAKOTAY: It's worth a try. Mister Lessing has agreed to show you how to adjust the sensors. Once you find the Ankari ship, set a course. PARIS: Aye, sir. E-EMH: Did our prisoner disclose any other information? CHAKOTAY: I'm afraid not. The rest of you continue with the repairs. Dismissed. JANEWAY: Commander. All right, we're going to try it your way, but I want to make one thing clear. CHAKOTAY: Our first priority is to get Ransom. If there's one thing you've made clear, it's that. JANEWAY: We've had our disagreements Chakotay, but you've never openly opposed me. CHAKOTAY: You almost killed that man today. JANEWAY: It was a calculated risk and I took it. CHAKOTAY: It was a bad call. JANEWAY: I'll note your objection in my log. CHAKOTAY: I don't give a damn about your log! This isn't about rules and regulations. It's about right and wrong, and I'm warning you, I won't let you cross that line again. JANEWAY: Then you leave me no choice. You are hereby relieved of duty until further notice. CHAKOTAY: What's happened to you, Kathryn? JANEWAY: I was about to ask you the same question. [Bridge] TUVOK: They are not responding. JANEWAY: Tractor beam. TUVOK: Captain, the Ankari ship has done nothing. JANEWAY: Just do it! KIM: We're being hailed. JANEWAY: On screen. ANKARI [on viewscreen]: Starfleet. JANEWAY: Yes. ANKARI [on viewscreen]: Leave us alone. There's nothing of value on our ship. JANEWAY: We need your guidance. Your spirits of good fortune are attacking us. ANKARI [on viewscreen]: Of course they are. You've been killing them. JANEWAY: We are not the ones responsible. ANKARI [on viewscreen]: Equinox. JANEWAY: That's right. Can you communicate with the aliens? ANKARI [on viewscreen]: Release my ship. JANEWAY: I can't do that. Not until you agree to talk to them. ANKARI [on viewscreen]: I will summon them but you must talk to them. You must convince them. [Cargo Bay two] ANKARI: They say they want the humans to die. TUVOK: A difficult place to start a negotiation. JANEWAY: Will they understand me? ANKARI: Yes. JANEWAY: We didn't do this to you. We're trying to stop the humans who did. ANKARI: They don't believe you would harm your own kind. JANEWAY: We have rules for behaviour. The Equinox has broken those rules by killing your species. It's our duty to stop them. ANKARI: Give us the Equinox. Give us the Equinox! They insist on destroying the ones who are responsible. TUVOK: We will punish them according to our own rules. They will be imprisoned. They will lose their freedom. JANEWAY: All right! If you stop your attacks, I'll deliver the Equinox to you!. TUVOK: Captain. JANEWAY: I know what I'm doing, Tuvok. TUVOK: These beings would destroy Captain Ransom and his crew. JANEWAY: What's their answer? TUVOK: Your behaviour is irrational. We could find another solution. JANEWAY: I've already confined my first Officer to quarters. Would you like to join him? Well? ANKARI: They agree, [Equinox Bridge] BURKE: We're going to need more fuel. We've only got enough left to jump another five hundred light years. RANSOM: Fuel. Is that the euphemism we're using now? You mean we need to kill more life forms. BURKE: Several more. [Equinox Sickbay] EMH: Oh, my darling, Oh, my darling, Oh, my darling SEVEN: Clementine. RANSOM: How much longer? EMH: Another hour, maybe less. You are lost and gone forever SEVEN: Dreadful sorry, Clementine. RANSOM: What are you doing? EMH: Her auditory processor. We used to practice duets together. In fact, I taught her this old chestnut. Light she was and like a fairy. SEVEN: And her shoes were Number Nine. EMH: Herring boxes without topses. SEVEN: Sandals were for Clementine. EMH: Drove she ducklings to the water RANSOM: Enough. EMH: Why the long face, Captain. You're about to get your crew home. She tried to stand in your way. You had no choice. RANSOM: No choice. Thank you, Doctor. EMH: When this is all over, perhaps you'll allow me to teach you my repertoire. I'm going to need a new partner. Hmm. Drove she ducklings to the water. [Equinox - Ransom's quarters] RANSOM: You. What are you doing here? SEVEN [in his mind]: Hiding, like you. RANSOM: I'm not hiding. SEVEN [in his mind]: It's beautiful. I can see why this brings you comfort. RANSOM: I don't know what you're talking about. SEVEN [in his mind]: But it isn't real. RANSOM: You're not real. Now leave me alone. SEVEN [in his mind]: It's not too late to stop. RANSOM: I don't have a choice. SEVEN [in his mind]: Find another way. RANSOM: There is no other way. SEVEN [in his mind]: Stop trying to hide. RANSOM: I told you I'm not hiding. Get away from me! SEVEN [in his mind]: End this. RANSOM: No! BURKE [OC]: Bridge to Ransom. RANSOM: Go ahead. BURKE [OC]: Janeway's found us. RANSOM: On my way. [Equinox Bridge] BURKE: Distance? GILMORE: Fifty thousand kilometres, closing fast. BURKE: Maintain course. Voyager's approaching at high warp. There's a class two nebula less than a light year from here. Janeway's sensors won't be able to track us once we're inside. I think that we should pursue this course. RANSOM: No. Open a channel. BURKE: Change of tactics? RANSOM: You might say that. It's time we found another way home. BURKE: Another way? RANSOM: We're going to co-operate with Janeway, Max, if she's willing. BURKE: Rudy, with all due respect, have you lost your mind? RANSOM: Just the opposite. GILMORE: They're within range. They're charging weapons! RANSOM: Hail them. BURKE: Belay that order. Raise shields. RANSOM: You're relieved of duty, Commander. BURKE: I'm taking command. Anyone who isn't with me, speak up now. Take him to the brig. GILMORE: I'm sorry. BURKE: What's the status of our weapons? THOMPSON: Full complement of torpedoes. Minimal phasers. BURKE: Open a secure channel to their Sickbay. Stand by weapons. THOMPSON: Aye sir. [Sickbay] E-EMH: I'm here. [Equinox Bridge] BURKE: We're going to need your help, Doctor. See if you can find Voyager's current shield frequency. [Sickbay] E-EMH: Acknowledged. I'll need a few minutes. [Bridge] TUVOK: They are firing torpedoes. KIM: Direct hit to our port shields. They're holding. JANEWAY: Return the favour. [Equinox Engineering] RANSOM: This isn't the brig. GILMORE: I know. I'm with you, sir. Let's find a way to end this. RANSOM: We'll need to access transporter control. [Bridge] KIM: We've damaged their port nacelle. They're venting plasma!. PARIS: They're dropping out of warp. JANEWAY: Stay with them. [Equinox Bridge] E-EMH [OC]: Doctor to Equinox. I've got their shield frequency. [Sickbay] E-EMH: I'm transmitting it to you now. BURKE [OC]: They'll try to remodulate. Keep monitoring. E-EMH: Aye sir. [Bridge] TORRES: They've slowed to one quarter impulse. JANEWAY: Prepare a tractor beam. TUVOK: They are launching another torpedo. JANEWAY: Full power to the forward shields. KIM: Hull breach on deck four! TORRES: How'd they get through our shields? JANEWAY: Hard about! Get us out of range. Remodulate the shields. [Equinox Bridge] THOMPSON: They're retreating. BURKE: Pursuit course. Maintain fire. [Bridge] KIM: They took out the weapons array. JANEWAY: Tuvok! TUVOK: I've been rotating the shield frequency every ten seconds. PARIS: We've lost impulse engines. KIM: We're being hailed. It's Ransom. JANEWAY: Put him through. RANSOM [on viewscreen]: Captain, I'm prepared to surrender the Equinox but I'm no longer in command. Max decided to stage a little mutiny but I think I can stop him. I've isolated transporter control. I can beam all of us to Voyager. You might want to have some guards standing by. Not everyone here is going to be happy to see you. JANEWAY: Proceed. PARIS: Ma'am? JANEWAY: He's still a Starfleet Captain. He may have forgotten that for a while, but I believe him. [Equinox Bridge] BURKE: Someone's trying to beam us off. Force fields! [Equinox Engineering] GILMORE: They're deflecting our targeting scanners. RANSOM: Then beam the others to Voyager, yourself included. I'll take care of Max. GILMORE: Aye, sir. RANSOM: Computer, Give me access to the shield grid. [Sickbay] EMH: Well I see you've made yourself at home. E-EMH: What are you doing here? EMH: Taking back my Sickbay! E-EMH: Stop where you are! I've planted photonic charges throughout these holo-projectors. With one command sequence, I can blow out your entire EMH: Computer, delete the Equinox EMH! [Equinox Bridge] THOMPSON: The Doctor's not transmitting anymore. BURKE: Burke to Doctor, report. EMH [OC]: I'm afraid your physician's no longer on call. RANSOM [OC]: Max, this is the Captain. I've dropped the shield grid [Equinox Engineering] RANSOM: everywhere except the bridge and my current location. [Equinox Bridge] RANSOM [OC]: The vital systems are exposed. [Equinox Engineering] RANSOM: I suggest you beam to Voyager while you still can. [Equinox Bridge] THOMPSON: The core is overloading. We've got to get out of here. BURKE: Where? Voyager's brig? THOMPSON: It's better than being vaporised. BURKE: We still have a working shuttle. THOMPSON: The shuttle bay's two decks down. Sir, the aliens! BURKE: We'll make it. [Equinox Corridor] BURKE: This way. [Bridge] KIM: There's only one life sign left. It's Ransom. JANEWAY: Captain. RANSOM [on viewscreen]: Things didn't work out exactly as I planned, but you've got everyone worth getting. JANEWAY: We're beaming you out of there. RANSOM [on viewscreen]: This ship is about to explode. I've got to put some distance between us. I've accessed helm control. JANEWAY: You can set auto-navigation and then transport to Voyager. RANSOM [on viewscreen]: There's no time! You've got a fine crew, Captain. Promise me you'll get them home. JANEWAY: I promise. Captain's Log, supplemental. With the Equinox destroyed, the aliens have withdrawn to their realm. I've reinstated Chakotay and we've set a course for home. [Sickbay] EMH: Good as new. I'd like you to regenerate for the next few hours. It'll help stabilise your cortical array. SEVEN: Understood. EMH: Regarding the unpleasantness aboard the Equinox. I hope you don't think less of me. SEVEN: Your programme was altered. EMH: It's quite disconcerting to know that all someone has to do is flick a switch to turn me into Mister Hyde. SEVEN: Perhaps you should enhance your programme with security protocols. It will prevent such tampering in the future. EMH: Good thinking. SEVEN: When I'm done regenerating, I will assist you. EMH: Thanks. SEVEN: You were off-key. EMH: I beg your pardon? SEVEN: My Darling Clementine, third verse, second measure. EMH: That's impossible. SEVEN: Your vocal modulations deviated by point three zero decihertz. I can assist you with that as well. EMH: Really? Holodeck two, tomorrow, sixteen hundred hours. Just you, me, and a tuning fork. SEVEN: I look forward to it. [Briefing room] JANEWAY: The last time we welcomed you aboard you took advantage of our trust. You betrayed this crew. I won't make that mistake again. Noah Lessing, Marla Gilmore, James Morrow, Brian Sofin, Angelo Tassoni, you are hereby stripped of rank. You'll be expected to serve as crewmen on this vessel. Your privileges will be limited and you'll serve under close supervision for as long as I deem fit. This time, you'll have to earn our trust. Dismissed. Repairs? CHAKOTAY: Coming along. [Bridge] JANEWAY: How's the crew? CHAKOTAY: A lot of frayed nerves. Neelix is organizing a potluck to help boost morale. JANEWAY: Will I see you there? CHAKOTAY: I'm replicating the salad. JANEWAY: I'll bring the croutons. Chakotay. You know, you may have had good reason to stage a little mutiny of your own. CHAKOTAY: The thought had occurred to me, but that would have been crossing the line. JANEWAY: Will you look at that. All these years, all these battles, this thing's never fallen down before. CHAKOTAY: Let's put it back up where it belongs. Star Trek ® is copyright of CBS Studios INC. The Star Trek web pages on this site are for educational and entertainment purposes only.

       "\"Title: The Gift Stardate: Unknown Original Airdate: 10 September, 1997 [Cargo Bay two] JANEWAY: So, how's the newest addition to our family? EMH: At the moment she's stable, but the prognosis isn't clear. Her human physiology has begun to reassert itself. Respiratory system, neurological functions, immune response. But those systems are swarming with Borg implants There's a battle being waged inside her body, between the biological and the technological, and I'm not sure which is going to win. JANEWAY: Well, it's time we brought her up to date. Wake her. SEVEN: Captain Janeway, What have you... The others, I can't hear the others. The voices are gone. JANEWAY: We had to neutralise the neuro-transceiver in your upper spinal column. Your link to the collective has been severed. SEVEN: You will return this drone to the Borg. JANEWAY: I'm afraid I can't do that SEVEN: You will return this drone to the Borg! JANEWAY: If I were to turn this ship around and head back into Borg territory I'd be putting my crew at risk. I'm not prepared to do that. Try to understand, you have to stay on board Voyager. But I'm offering you freedom from the Collective, and I assure you we will do everything we can to help the transition SEVEN: You will supply us with a subspace transmitter and leave us on the nearest planet. The Borg will come for us. JANEWAY: It's too late for that. Your human cells are starting to regenerate. You won't survive without medical care. SEVEN: We need nothing from you. We are Borg. We are - ah! EMH: This implant is being rejected by the tissue underneath. It's going to have to be removed. SEVEN: You will suppress the human immune system! EMH: I'm sorry, but the process has gone too far. We've got to get you to sickbay. SEVEN: No! We are Borg! We are Borg! [Sickbay] EMH: This armour plating is anchored to the skull with over three million microconnectors. There's no time to cut through them. I'm going to have to remove the outer layer of the skull itself. Lieutenant, will you please leave the surgical bay! TUVOK: This Borg is a security risk. EMH: She is heavily sedated. I assure you she's not going anywhere. Thank you. Kes, I want you to anaesthetise her cranial nerves. Twenty milligrams inetrazine. KES: Yes Doctor. EMH: Kes? KES: I don't know what happened. I looked at the hypospray and it just came to me. TUVOK: Have you been experimenting with your psycho-kinetic abilities? KES: No, not for months, but I have been feeling a little strange lately. Lots of energy, sleeping less. EMH: I can see why. Your seratonin levels are sixty two percent above normal. It's the telepathic centres of your brain. They're in a state of hyperstimulation like they were a few days ago when you were in contact with species 8472. TUVOK: Are they attempting to communicate with you again? KES: No, this time it's different. I don't feel their presence at all. TUVOK: Perhaps she's experiencing an after effect of some kind. EMH: A reasonable diagnosis, for a security officer. I'll run a full microsynaptic analysis, but it will have to wait. We should get back to our Borg. [Ready Room] JANEWAY: Come in. CHAKOTAY: Ship's status report. We've got two teams on the hull, stripping off the Borg armour. They're working around the clock but it's still slow going. JANEWAY: What about the warp drive? CHAKOTAY: Torres is having problems cleaning out the plasma relays. It's disrupting the antimatter reaction. Until she's got it fixed we're stuck at impulse. She's requesting all personnel with a level three engineering rating or higher to lend a hand. JANEWAY: Granted. Tactical update? CHAKOTAY: Long range sensors are picking up residual transwarp signatures, Borg vessels. They passed by probably three days ago. JANEWAY: So we're not out of the woods yet. CHAKOTAY: Having half our propulsion system overrun by Borg implants doesn't make repairs any easier. JANEWAY: Seven of Nine could help with that. CHAKOTAY: That might be true if she were willing, but she's not in the most co-operative mood. JANEWAY: That could change. I just have to reach her somehow. Annika Hansen. CHAKOTAY: Our Borg? JANEWAY: It took some digging through the Federation database but I managed to find a single entry in the records of Deep Space Four. Her parents were unconventional. They fancied themselves explorers but wanted nothing to do with Starfleet or the Federation. Their names were last recorded at a remote outpost in the Omega sector. They refused to file a flight plan. Apparently, they aimed their small ship towards the Delta Quadrant and were never heard from again. CHAKOTAY: For all we know, Annika and her parents were the first humans the Borg ever assimilated. JANEWAY: From what she's told me, that was almost twenty years ago. CHAKOTAY: So she was raised by the Borg. It's the only life she ever really knew. If you were thinking of bringing her into the fold, that might not be possible. JANEWAY: What's the alternative? Toss her back to the wolves? EMH [OC]: Sickbay to Captain Janeway. JANEWAY: What is it, Doctor? EMH [OC]: Could you come down here, Captain. We're having some problems. JANEWAY: I'll be right there. [Sickbay] EMH: It's like peeling an onion. Store it in a bio-stasis chamber. It may still be active. If you think there's a risk, Mister Tuvok, you can throw one of your little forcefields around the chamber. TUVOK: A prudent security measure, for a doctor. JANEWAY: Report. EMH: I'm afraid we have a decision to make. A difficult one. Her human immune system has reasserted itself with a vengeance. Body armour, Borg organelles, biosynthetic glands, they're all being rejected. Her life is in danger. I have little recourse but to remove the Borg technology. JANEWAY: Which is the last thing Seven of Nine would want. EMH: Hence the difficult decision. If a patient told me not to treat them, even if the situation were life threatening I would be ethically obligated to honour that request. JANEWAY: This is no ordinary patient. She may have been raised by Borg, raised to think like a Borg, but she's with us now, and underneath all that technology she is a human being whether she's ready to accept that or not. And until she is ready someone has to make the decisions for her. Proceed with the surgery. EMH: Aye, Captain. Kes? Let's begin with the microtubular network embedded in the oesophageal tract. TUVOK: What's happening? EMH: I'm not sure. She's going into neural shock. I can't localise the source. Kes, try to stabilise her motor cortex. Use a neurosequencer. Kes, I said to stabilise her cortex or we're going to lose her. KES: Wait. I can see it. EMH: What? KES: I think the problem is in her caligulae. Yes, I can see it. A Borg implant. It's pressing against her tracheal nerve. EMH: Can you tell me how we might remove it without severing the nerve? KES: I think I can do more than tell you. EMH: The implant is deteriorating. Her nervous system is stabilising. Nice work, Kes. Unconventional but effective. EMH: They say the eye is the window to the soul. In this case it's a little bit more. I've fabricated this artificial organ to replace her eyepiece, but I've had to retain some of the Borg circuitry along the optic nerve. As a result, she'll have increased acuity in one eye. Note how perfectly I've matched the pigment of the iris to her human eye. JANEWAY: Excellent work, Doctor. I admire your attention to detail. When can I speak with her? EMH: She's out of immediate danger, and I don't plan to resume the extraction process until tomorrow. I can wake her now, if you'd like. JANEWAY: I would. How are you, Kes? KES: I feel exhilarated, Captain. I've never been so focused in my life, and my telepathic abilities are stronger than they've ever been. TUVOK: Your performance today was astonishing. However, your psychokinetic powers are still undisciplined, and as a result, unpredictable. KES: I feel like I'm in control. TUVOK: Nevertheless, you must proceed with caution, and with my assistance. JANEWAY: What are you suggesting? TUVOK: A series of guided meditations to help her explore the depth of these new abilities. JANEWAY: Kes? KES: I'm ready. TUVOK: Well then, if you'll excuse us, we should begin immediately. EMH: Ready when you are, Captain. Don't be alarmed. You're in sickbay. You're going to be fine. SEVEN: What have you done to me! EMH: Your body was rejecting the Borg technology. You were dying. I'm sorry, but we had no choice. Those are dermoplastic grafts. They'll help the regeneration process. SEVEN: Unacceptable. You should have let us die. JANEWAY: I couldn't do that. SEVEN: This drone cannot survive outside the Collective. EMH: I beg to differ. Now that the Borg implants are being excised your human systems are free to thrive, and thriving they are. As a matter of fact, I JANEWAY: I want to help you but I need to understand what you're going through. SEVEN: Do not engage us in superficial attempts at sympathy. JANEWAY: It's obvious that you're in pain, that you're frightened, that you feel isolated, alone. SEVEN: You are an individual. You are small. You cannot understand what it is to be Borg. JANEWAY: No, but I can imagine. You were part of a vast consciousness, billions of minds working together, a harmony of purpose and thought. No indecision, no doubts. The security and strength of a unified will. And you've lost that. SEVEN: This drone is small now. Alone. One voice, one mind. The silence is unacceptable. We need the others! JANEWAY: I can't give you back to the Borg, but you're not alone. You're part of a human community now. A human collective. We may be individuals but we live and work together. You can have some of the unity you require right here on Voyager. SEVEN: Insufficient. JANEWAY: It'll have to do. And the fact is, this community needs you. The Borg modifications you made to our vessel are disrupting our warp drive. We need your help to remove them, your expertise, your co-operation. You must comply. [Engineering] TORRES: Alright, I think I've got all the Borg garbage out of the plasma intake manifold. Let's try reinitialising the antimatter reaction. KIM: Matter antimatter reaction at twenty two cochranes and rising. TORRES: Damn! What happened? KIM: Intake manifolds eleven and thirteen are still blocked! TORRES: This is like pulling weeds. You think you've got them all out and then SEVEN: You have neglected to remove the autonomous regeneration sequencers. JANEWAY: LieutenantTorres, Ensign Kim, you remember Seven of Nine. KIM: How could we forget? JANEWAY: We can't afford to delay repairs any longer so I've asked her to help us remove the Borg modifications. She only has a few hours before she returns to sickbay. I suggest you put here to good use. TORRES: You can start with the plasma relays. They're in Jefferies tube thirteen. SEVEN: Jefferies tube thirteen alpha section twelve. We fully recall the engineering specifications of your vessel. TORRES: Good. Can you also recall the way it looked before you turned it into a Borg circus? SEVEN: Yes. JANEWAY: Well, now that the pleasantries are over, why don't you get to work. I want updates every hour. TORRES: Yes, Captain. [Kes's Quarters] TUVOK: The flame of the lamp is fire disciplined, tamed and under control. It is the appropriate focus for the task ahead of us. KES: How do we begin? TUVOK: I will attempt to guide you in manipulating the flame at the subatomic level. Concentrate on the flame. Try to see past the surface, past the light, to the patterns of energy and matter. KES: I can see the essence of the fire. TUVOK: Good. Now reach out with your mind and intensify the flame. KES: I'm making it hotter, brighter. TUVOK: Now, with your thoughts, reduce the flame. Excellent. You never demonstrated this level of control before. KES: It's as though I knew what had to be done. TUVOK: What's wrong? KES: Something's happening. I can see further, beyond the subatomic. TUVOK: Kes, there is nothing beyond the subatomic. KES: But I can see it, Tuvok. It's a new level of reality. It's beautiful. TUVOK: Perhaps we should stop for now. KES: Wait a few seconds. I want to try to control it. Don't worry, Tuvok, [Engineering] TORRES: What about these linkages. Every time I pull one out another one comes back in it's place. SEVEN: Autonomous regeneration sequencers. They function to counteract resistance. KIM: Amazing. How did you come up with the pattern duplication design? SEVEN: We came up with nothing. The Borg assimilated this technology in Galactic Cluster three from species two five nine. TORRES: I'm not interested in a history lesson. How do we disable it? SEVEN: You must disconnect each sequencer conduit at the insertion juncture. TORRES: Why don't you two work on the Jefferies tube. Start with the plasma relays. [Jefferies Tube thirteen] KIM: I'll start here. You said the Borg got this stuff from species two five nine. Who are they? Guess the Borg meet a lot of people, don't they? Stupid question. So, what's it like out there in Galactic Cluster three? SEVEN: Beyond your comprehension. KIM: Try me. SEVEN: Galactic Cluster three is a transmaterial energy plane intersecting twenty two billion omnicordial life forms. KIM: Ah. Interesting. SEVEN: Ensign Kim. Your assistance. [Bridge] PARIS: Captain, somebody's trying to access the subspace transmitter. [Engineering] TORRES: Captain, I don't know how, but she's erected some kind of forcefield around the door. We can't break through it. [Bridge] CHAKOTAY: She's bypassed our security protocols. JANEWAY: Disable the transmitter. CHAKOTAY: It's too late. [Kes's Quarters] TUVOK: It's obvious your mental abilities have progressed beyond this particular Vulcan exercise. I suggest we - What is it? KES: Something's wrong. The Borg is trying to contact her people. TUVOK: Tuvok to Security team one. Intruder alert in engineering. KES: Wait. I think I can stop her. It's over. TUVOK: Tuvok to bridge. Status. [Bridge] JANEWAY: There was some kind of explosion in the Jefferies tube just as she was about to initiate her transmission. [Kes's Quarters] JANEWAY [OC]: We don't know what caused it. TUVOK: I believe I may have the answer, Captain. [Corridor] JANEWAY: I can tell by the expression on your face that you've got some bad news. TUVOK: I have no expression on my face. However, you are correct. The news on two separate fronts is not good. I checked the subspace bandwidths. At least a partial signal was transmitted from Voyager. JANEWAY: Enough for a Borg ship to track? TUVOK: Possibly. JANEWAY: And the second front? TUVOK: I believe there is also cause for concern regarding Kes. JANEWAY: Explain. TUVOK: Internal sensor logs show that she destabilised the Jefferies tube at the molecular level. The effect weakened the infrastructure throughout the deck. If she wishes to develop her abilities further I am not certain it would be safe, for Kes or Voyager. JANEWAY: I've got an Ocampan who wants to be something more and a Borg who's afraid of becoming something less. Here's to Vulcan stability. Wait for me. [Brig] SEVEN: So this is human freedom. JANEWAY: I've decided to keep you in the brig until I'm certain you won't try to harm us again. If necessary the Doctor can treat you here. I honestly believed you were going to help us. SEVEN: You were not deceived, Captain Janeway. It was my intention to help you. JANEWAY: What happened? SEVEN: There was a chance to contact the Collective. I took advantage of it. Your attempt to assimilated this drone will fail. You can alter our physiology but cannot change our nature. We will betray you. We are Borg. JANEWAY: I've met Borg who were freed from the collective. It wasn't easy for them to accept their individuality, but in time they did. You're no different. Granted, you were assimilated at a very young age, and your transition may be more difficult, but it will happen. SEVEN: If it does happen, we will become fully human? JANEWAY: Yes, I hope so. SEVEN: We will be autonomous, independent. JANEWAY: That's what individuality is all about. SEVEN: If at that time we choose to return to the Collective, will you permit it? JANEWAY: I don't think you'll want to do that. SEVEN: You would deny us the choice as you deny us now. You have imprisoned us in the name of humanity yet you will not grant us your most cherished human right. To choose our own fate. You are hypocritical, manipulative. We do not want to be what you are! Return us to the Collective! JANEWAY: You lost the capacity to make a rational choice the moment you were assimilated. They took that from you, and until I'm convinced you've gotten it back I'm making the choice for you. You're staying here. SEVEN: Then you are no different than the Borg. [Mess hall] NEELIX: Talaxian champagne, moon-ripened. Your favourite. KES: Neelix, where did you get this? NEELIX: I put a bottle away for a special occasion. Remember when we last sipped this together? KES: Three years ago. It was when we first arrived on Voyager. NEELIX: And do you remember the toast I made? KES: Yes. To the adventure. NEELIX: To the adventure. When you left Ocampa you said that your people were being held beck. That if you were only given the chance you could become something so much more. And you have. KES: I don't think things have worked out exactly the way we planned. NEELIX: I was only holding you back. That's obvious to me now. KES: No. I couldn't have come this far without you. And I love you. I always will. It's just, erm, NEELIX: My cooking. You've always hated my cooking. KES: That's exactly what it was. NEELIX: Ah. So tell me more about what's happening to you. What's it all mean? KES: I don't know, and that's what makes it all so exciting. It's as if I can see into a place where the distinction between matter and energy and thought no longer exists. And that's only the beginning. I feel as if all the boundaries within me are about to fall away. NEELIX: It sounds ah, sper, ah, interesting. KES: I only have to look at an object, to gaze at it, and I can begin to see that the space between the atoms is being filled with something else. NEELIX: Er, Kes. KES: I can see them, I can see. NEELIX: Kes! Stop! KES: No. Neelix! [Bridge] KIM: Captain, I'm picking up some strange energy readings from deck two, the mess hall. JANEWAY: Bridge to Neelix. What's going on down there? Neelix, report. KIM: The bulkhead in that section is coming apart. CHAKOTAY: Increase the structural integrity field to deck two. JANEWAY: Tuvok. [Sickbay - Doctor's office] EMH: I've run every conceivable neural analysis. Everything short of dissecting the brain itself. Her telesynaptic activity is increasing but I don't know why, or how to stop it. Have the ship's internal sensors revealed anything? TUVOK: For seventeen point four seconds Kes's body went into a state of cellular flux. She began to destabilise at the subatomic level. JANEWAY: Then for some reason her atoms re-established their bonds and she was back in one piece. EMH: But what about the next time? Her condition is escalating. We must find a way to suppress it or the last we see of Kes could very well be her molecules blowing through the ventilation ducts. JANEWAY: Tuvok, enhance the structural integrity fields throughout the ship. If she has another incident I'd like to avoid a hull breach. Doctor, maybe it's time we broaden our horizons. This appears to have gone beyond medical science. We're into particle physics now. EMH: I'll try looking through the quantum substructure database. Maybe it'll give me some inspiration. JANEWAY: Keep me informed. {Sickbay] EMH: Kes, until I can devise another diagnostic procedure you're free to return to your quarters. KES: Actually I'd like to stay here, help with the research. EMH: I don't want you to overexert yourself and risk precipitating another telepathic incident. Try to get some rest. KES: Just let me stay for a little while. I haven't seen you much over the past few days. I miss you. EMH: All right, just for a while. [Bridge] AYALA [OC]: Ensign Ayala to the bridge. JANEWAY: Go ahead, Ensign. AYALA [OC]: You'd better come down to the brig, ma'am. [Brig] SEVEN: One. One. My designation is Seven of Nine, but the others are gone. Designations are no longer relevant. I am - one. JANEWAY: Yes, you are. SEVEN: But I cannot function this way. Alone. JANEWAY: You're not alone. I'm willing to help you. SEVEN: If that's true, you won't do this to me. Take me back to my own kind. JANEWAY: You are with your own kind. Humans. SEVEN: I don't remember being human. I don't know what it is to be human. What are you doing? JANEWAY: I'm coming in. SEVEN: I'll kill you. JANEWAY: I don't think you will. Do you remember her? Her name was Annika Hansen. She was born on stardate 25479 at the Tendara Colony. There's still a lot we don't know about her. Did she have any siblings? Who were her friends? Where did she go to school? What was her favourite colour? SEVEN: Irrelevant! Take me back to the Borg. JANEWAY: I can't do that. SEVEN: So quiet. One voice. JANEWAY: One voice can be stronger than a thousand voices. Your mind is independent now, with it's own unique identity. SEVEN: You are forcing that identity upon me. It's not mine. JANEWAY: Oh yes it is. I'm just giving you back what was stolen from you. The existence you were denied, the child who never had a chance, that life is yours to live now. SEVEN: Don't want that life. JANEWAY: It's what you are. Don't resist it. Captain's log, supplemental. Warp drive is still offline and we don't know whether the Borg have detected us. Kes's psychokinetic abilities continue to damage the ship's structural integrity, and as a result our defences have been compromised. [Kes's Quarters] KES: Come in, Captain. JANEWAY: You wanted to see me. Ah, Tuvok's meditation lamp. I was with him when he got it six years ago from a Vulcan master, at double the price when he saw our Starfleet insignias. KES: I'm sure it was the logical thing to do. I've been thinking about everything that's been going on and I know what I have to do. It's time for me to leave Voyager. JANEWAY: Oh, Kes. KES: Something important is happening to me and I want to explore it, but I can't stay here any longer. I'm a danger to all of you. JANEWAY: We're going to get to the bottom of this. The Doctor's already working on a new approach. KES: Everybody thinks that what's happening is a medical condition. That's not it at all. I'm going though a transformation. I don't know how or why, but every cell in my body is telling me that I'm changing into something more. JANEWAY: What if it's not true? What if you're simply being swept up in the excitement of something you think is happening, but it's not real? On the basis of a feeling, an intuition, you're asking me to let you go. Quite likely for ever. Kes, I just can't do that. KES: It's my decision. My fate. Would you really try to stop me? JANEWAY: No, but argue with you, even plead with you to reconsider, absolutely, for as long as it takes. KES: It won't work. Look at me, Captain. I'm the same Kes you've always known. I haven't lost my judgment. I'm not under some alien influence. I believe something crucial is happening to me and I want to see it through. JANEWAY: You've lived most of your life here. Voyager has been your home and you've been a vital part of this family. Oh, I'm going to miss you. KES: Now all I have to do is tell the Doctor. He's not going to be happy. It's starting. JANEWAY: Janeway to bridge. [Bridge] CHAKOTAY: Chakotay here. JANEWAY [OC]: Prepare a shuttle for launch and have Tuvok meet me on deck six. CHAKOTAY: Captain? JANEWAY [OC]: Kes is leaving us. [Corridor] JANEWAY: Come on. KES: Captain, I can't stop it. JANEWAY: Janeway to Chakotay. Beam us directly to the shuttlebay. [Bridge] KIM: The molecules in Kes's body are destabilising. It's interfering with the transporter. CHAKOTAY: Captain, we can't get a lock. [Corridor] JANEWAY: Acknowledged. Looks like we're going to have to do this the hard way. [Bridge] CHAKOTAY: What's happening? PARIS: The hull is destabilising. The molecular bonds are breaking down. [Corridor] KES: Tuvok. I can't keep going. TUVOK: I will attempt a mind meld to help you delay the transformation. Our minds are one. Our thoughts are one. Try to regain control for a moment. Only for a moment. Only for a moment. You must hurry. [Bridge] KIM: Hull breach on decks three, four and five. CHAKOTAY: Emergency containment fields. JANEWAY [OC]: Janeway to the bridge. Kes is aboard the shuttle. Initiate launch sequence. CHAKOTAY: Acknowledged. PARIS: Shuttle distance, one hundred thousand kilometres. Speed, one quarter impulse. JANEWAY: Can you hail her? KIM: I've been trying. KES [OC]: It's happening. It's happening to me. KIM: Her atomic structure is completely destabilising. [Shuttlecraft] KES: My gift to you. [Engineering] TORRES: Torres to bridge. The warp core just came online. [Bridge] TORRES [OC]: Matter antimatter reaction at one hundred and [Engineering] TORRES: two percent. A hundred and ten percent. A hundred and twenty! [Bridge] PARIS: This can't be right. Our speed is - it's impossible! KIM: We're coming apart! PARIS: We've just dropped out of whatever it was we were in. CHAKOTAY: Systems coming back online. JANEWAY: On screen. Where are we? PARIS: Nine point five thousand light years from where we just were. JANEWAY: She's thrown us safely beyond Borg space. Ten years closer to home. [Cargo Bay two] EMH: I've extracted eighty two percent of the Borg hardware. The remaining bio-implants are stable and better than anything I could synthesise at such short notice. SEVEN: It is acceptable. EMH: Fashion, of course, is hardly my forte. Nevertheless I've managed to balance functionality and aesthetics in a pleasing enough manner. I also took the liberty of stimulating your hair follicles. A vicarious experience for me, as you might imagine. JANEWAY: You'll have to spend a few hours each day regenerating in a Borg alcove until your human metabolism can function on it's own. We'll leave one operational. SEVEN: Understood. JANEWAY: Let's see how things go over the next few weeks. I'll consider granting you access to the rest of the ship once that I can trust that you won't try to get us all assimilated again. SEVEN: It will not happen again. JANEWAY: Good. If you need anything, contact me. SEVEN: Red. JANEWAY: What? SEVEN: The child you spoke of, the girl. Her favourite colour was red.

       "\"Title: Scorpion, Part 2 Stardate: 51001.2 Original Airdate: Sept 3rd, 1997 [Bridge] CHAKOTAY: Report. TORRES: The Borg shields are off-line. I've got a lock on Captain Janeway. CHAKOTAY: Get her out of there and break us free of the Cube. Stand by all weapons. TORRES: I'm trying to energise. The Borg are scattering the beam. CHAKOTAY: Compensate. TORRES: No effect. TUVOK: We're being hailed. CHAKOTAY: On screen. JANEWAY [on viewscreen]: Commander. Cut the transporter beam. CHAKOTAY: Captain? JANEWAY [on viewscreen]: Do it. I've reached an agreement with the Collective. We're going to help them design a weapon against Species 8472. In exchange, they've granted us safe passage through their space. PARIS: The Cube is altering course. They're heading toward the Alpha Quadrant. JANEWAY [on viewscreen]: That's part of the plan. We'll work on the weapon en route. Once we're across their territory, we'll give them the nanoprobes. They appear to be holding up their end of the bargain. I suggest we do the same. CHAKOTAY: How do you propose we begin this collaboration? JANEWAY [on viewscreen]: I'm going to work here, on the Cube. They have technology that'll make the job go faster. I want to take advantage of it. CHAKOTAY: It's not necessary for you to stay there. We can set up a comlink with the Borg and JANEWAY [on viewscreen]: It's part of the deal. I work here. CHAKOTAY: All right. As long as we're co-operating, maybe the Borg would be willing to disengage their tractor beam. We can match their course without a leash. JANEWAY [on viewscreen]: I'll propose it. Mister Tuvok, transport to my co-ordinates. TUVOK: Understood. JANEWAY [on viewscreen]: We're going to make this work, Commander. Janeway out. CHAKOTAY: You heard the Captain. [Sickbay] EMH: I've replicated nearly ten million Borg nanoprobes, each of them reprogrammed to my specifications, each capable of targeting the alien tissue. CHAKOTAY: Assimilating it. EMH: Just momentarily. The Borg technology will denaturate within seconds, taking the alien tissue along with it. Mister Kim, I'm about to inject your carotid artery. You'll feel a tingling sensation. Don't be alarmed. Nice to see you again, Ensign. KES: It's working. EMH: Prepare another dose of nanoprobes. KES: Yes, Doctor. CHAKOTAY: Good work. Let me know when he's back on his feet. EMH: Commander. I must tell you, I have my doubts about this alliance. You may have convinced the Borg the nanoprobes can defeat their enemy, but a medical treatment is a long way from a weapon of war. CHAKOTAY: Leave that to the Captain. This situation is unpredictable so we're going to stay at full Red Alert. Keep all information about the nanoprobes stored in your holo-matrix. EMH: Don't worry. I'll delete myself at the first sign of trouble. Well, maybe not the first sign. [Bridge] TORRES: We've just received word. Tuvok beamed to the Cube. He's joined the Captain. CHAKOTAY: Keep a transporter lock on both of them. TORRES: I'll try, but the Borg are already regenerating their shields. CHAKOTAY: Try matching their shield frequencies. TORRES: It won't work. They'll be able to adapt too quickly. CHAKOTAY: I don't want to hear what we can't do, Lieutenant! Just find a way to get our people out of there if we have to. TORRES: Aye, sir. PARIS: They've released their tractor beam. CHAKOTAY: Match their course and speed. PARIS: I never thought I'd hear myself say this, but, looks like the Borg are co-operating. [Sickbay] EMH: Kes! Kes! Kes! What's wrong? KES: They're watching us. [Borg Cube] TUVOK: May I ask where we're being taken? JANEWAY: Grid nine two of subjunction twelve. Our very own workspace. It's near the centre of the Cube. TUVOK: These are my tricorder readings of the bio-ship we examined. I believe you will find them most revealing. JANEWAY: Have you compared this to the Doctor's analysis of the alien tissue? TUVOK: Yes. Many of the cellular structures are identical. JANEWAY: The aliens and their ships are made of the same organic material. TUVOK: Apparently so. [Borg Chamber] BORG [OC]: You have entered grid nine two of subjunction twelve. Proceed. JANEWAY: All right. We've analysed one of the alien vessels, and it appears to be constructed of organic material vulnerable to the modified nanoprobes. I suggest we begin thinking about a large-scale delivery system, a way to infect their ships and destroy them at the microscopic BORG [OC]: We will begin. TUVOK: What are you doing? BORG [OC]: A neuro-transceiver is required for maximum communication. We will work as one mind. JANEWAY: No. That wasn't the agreement. BORG [OC]: The neural link is temporary. You will not be damaged. JANEWAY: I don't care. I prefer to communicate verbally, thank you. BORG [OC]: Your primitive communication is inefficient. TUVOK: On the contrary. We work better with our individuality intact. Surely, we've proven that to you by now. BORG [OC]: Irrelevant. You must comply. JANEWAY: We must do nothing. Tell your drone to remove the transceiver. What about choosing a representative? A single Borg we can work with and talk to directly. BORG [OC]: Elaborate. JANEWAY: You've done it before. When you transformed Jean-Luc Picard into Locutus. We will not be assimilated. Choose a representative or the deal's off. SEVEN: I speak for the Borg. JANEWAY: I'm Captain Janeway. This is Lieutenant Tuvok. SEVEN: We are aware of your designations. JANEWAY: What's your designation? SEVEN: Seven of Nine, Tertiary Adjunct of Unimatrix Zero One. But you may call me Seven of Nine. You are proposing a large-scale weapon. We concur. JANEWAY: I thought you might. TUVOK: We could encase the nanoprobes in some of our photon torpedoes. In essence, turn them into bio molecular warheads. SEVEN: Your torpedoes are inadequate. They lack the necessary range and dispursive force. JANEWAY: Do you have a better idea? SEVEN: We are Borg. TUVOK: I take that as a yes. SEVEN: A multikinetic neutronic mine. Five million isoton yield. TUVOK: An explosion that size could affect an entire star system. SEVEN: Correct. The shock wave will disperse the nanoprobes over a radius of five light years. JANEWAY: That's somewhat larger than I had in mind. You're proposing a weapon of mass destruction. SEVEN: We are. JANEWAY: Well, I'm not. You'd be endangering innocent worlds. SEVEN: It would be efficient. TUVOK: We'd need approximately fifty trillion nanoprobes to arm this mine. It would take the Doctor several weeks to replicate that amount. You are losing this conflict. Are you willing to risk further delay? JANEWAY: Right now your enemy believes it is invulnerable. If we create smaller weapons using our torpedoes and destroy a few of their bio-ships, it may deter them, convince them to give up this war. SEVEN: You are individuals. You are small, and you think in small terms. But the present situation requires that we consider your plan. Voyager's weapons inventory. Photon torpedo complement thirty-two class six warhead. Explosive yield two hundred isotons. TUVOK: How did you obtain this information? SEVEN: We are Borg. TUVOK: Naturally. [Sickbay] EMH: Commander, we have some disturbing news. CHAKOTAY: At this point, I'm getting used to it. EMH: Her telepathic visions are increasing, both in frequency and intensity. KES: It feels different this time. It's almost like they're right here, in the room. EMH: There is it again. KES: I'm trying to block them out, but I can't. EMH: Every time she has a vision specific regions of her cerebral cortex go into a state of hyper-stimulation. Memory engrams, perceptual centres. I can't be sure but I think there's more going on here than just a simple hello. [Borg Chamber] JANEWAY: Enhance this grid. I want to take a closer look at the detonator. SEVEN: We must analyse the bio-ship. Your data. JANEWAY: You're human, aren't you? SEVEN: This body was assimilated eighteen years ago. It ceased to be human at that time. JANEWAY: I'm curious. What was your name before you were SEVEN: Do not engage us in further irrelevant discourse. We are being hailed by your vessel. JANEWAY: Commander, what is it? CHAKOTAY [on monitor]: It's Kes. The Doctor believes that the aliens are accessing her memory. JANEWAY: If that's true, they may already know what we're planning. CHAKOTAY [on monitor]: I've ordered long range scans for bio-ships. Nothing so far. JANEWAY: We should alter course, try to throw them off. SEVEN: Agreed. Our course and heading have been changed. JANEWAY: Match them, and keep me apprised of any changes in Kes. CHAKOTAY [on monitor]: Chakotay out. SEVEN: We now require one of your photon torpedoes and the nanoprobes. JANEWAY: One step at a time. We're not safely across your territory yet. SEVEN: We must construct and test a prototype now. The risk of attack has increased. JANEWAY: Irrelevant. We have an agreement. You're asking me to give up my only guarantee that you won't assimilate us. I won't risk it. SEVEN: Are you willing to risk a direct confrontation with us? If we transport five hundred drones onto your vessel do you believe you could offer sufficient resistance? JANEWAY: We'd die trying. SEVEN: That won't be necessary. We must construct a launching system to accommodate this design. [Bridge] CHAKOTAY: Glad you could join us, Mister Kim. PARIS: Harry. Welcome back. KIM: Thanks. Reporting for duty, sir. The Doctor gave me a clean bill of health. Did I miss anything? CHAKOTAY: Not too much. Take your station, Ensign. TORRES: You've still got a tendril up your nose. PARIS: Commander. I'm picking up gravimetric distortions twelve thousand kilometres aft. It's a singularity. [Borg Chamber] SEVEN: We are under attack. [Bridge] PARIS: They're charging weapons. CHAKOTAY: Shields! Keep a lock on the Away Team! TORRES: Direct hit to our secondary hull! KIM: Transporters are off-line! Shields and weapons are down. [Borg Chamber] TUVOK: Voyager has taken heavy damage. SEVEN: We cannot let the nanoprobes be destroyed. [Bridge] PARIS: We're being targeted! CHAKOTAY: Brace for impact! The Cube? PARIS: Destroyed, and it took the bio-ship with it. TUVOK [OC]: Tuvok to Chakotay. CHAKOTAY: Go ahead, Tuvok. Where are you? TUVOK [OC]: I'm in Cargo Bay Two [Cargo Bay Two] TUVOK: Along with the Captain and a number of Borg. [Bridge] TUVOK [OC]: We were beamed over just before impact. We require assistance. CHAKOTAY: Tuvok. Tuvok? Secure that deck. Security Team to Cargo Bay Two. Paris, you have the Bridge. [Cargo Bay Two] SEVEN: Lower your weapons. We are here with your Captain's consent. It was necessary to sacrifice our vessel to protect yours. We have an alliance do we not? [Sickbay] CHAKOTAY: For now they're contained. They've assimilated Cargo Bay Two and they're drawing energy from the secondary power couplings. TUVOK: But they've gone no further. CHAKOTAY: Not yet. I've sealed off Decks Nine through Thirteen and posted security details at every access point. TUVOK: I suggest we increase security around Sickbay, as well. CHAKOTAY: Already done. How far did you get on the weapon? TUVOK: We're ready to construct a prototype. KES: You're fit to return to duty, Lieutenant. TUVOK: And you, Kes? KES: Oh, I'm all right. The visions have stopped for now. EMH: The plasma burns to her thoracic region I can treat, and I've already stopped the internal bleeding. But her neural injuries are going to require some creative thinking. TUVOK: Before we beamed out, an alien energy discharge struck very near the Captain. EMH: Well, it appears to have disrupted all her neuroelectrical pathways. I'll have to induce a coma to protect her higher brain functions. But I must tell you, unless I can repair the damage, she may never regain consciousness. CHAKOTAY: Make sure those Borg stay put. I want tactical updates every twenty minutes. TUVOK: Aye, sir. Shall I resume working with them? CHAKOTAY: Stand by for now. EMH: The Captain wishes to speak with you. Please keep it brief. JANEWAY: The Doctor explained my condition. You're in command. CHAKOTAY: I understand. JANEWAY: They'll push you, they'll threaten you, but they need you. They need this alliance. You have to make this work. I want you to make this work. Get this crew home. EMH: I must begin. [Cargo Bay Two] SEVEN: Where is your Captain? I must speak with her. CHAKOTAY: In our medical bay, recovering. You'll be dealing with me now. SEVEN: Circumstances have changed. CHAKOTAY: I'd say so. SEVEN: The loss of our vessel requires that we modify our agreement. CHAKOTAY: I've been giving that some thought. I'm willing to let you stay on board. We'll continue to work with you on the weapon. Once we're safely out of Borg territory we'll give you the nanoprobes, shake hands and part company. SEVEN: Insufficient. Our latest tactical projections indicate that the war will be lost by then. The nearest Borg vessel is forty light years away. You will reverse course and take us to it. CHAKOTAY: Even at maximum warp, that's a five day journey in the wrong direction. We're supposed to be heading out of Borg space, not deeper into it. SEVEN: There is no alternative. CHAKOTAY: Look, I'll honour the original agreement, but I'm not turning this ship around. It's too dangerous. SEVEN: Denying our request is also dangerous. CHAKOTAY: I'll think about it. SEVEN: Think quickly. [Briefing Room] CHAKOTAY: A five day trip back into the heart of Borg territory. It's too risky. With those drones and the nanoprobes on board, we might as well have a bull's-eye painted on our hull. We're a prime target for Species 8472. We'd never survive another attack. NEELIX: What is the alternative? CHAKOTAY: I'm going to end this alliance here and now. We're going to drop the Borg off on the next uninhabited planet, give them the nanoprobes and take our chances alone. They can wait for a Borg ship to pick them up and finish the weapon. I'm in command now and I have to do what I think is best for this crew. Tom, I want you to scan for the nearest uninhabited planet and set a course. PARIS: Aye Sir. TUVOK: I must caution you, Commander. The Borg may not go quietly. CHAKOTAY: We'll see. Bring that female drone to the Ready Room. Dismissed. [Ready Room] CHAKOTAY: Once we've beamed you to the surface we'll send down the nanoprobes and all our research. SEVEN: Unacceptable. We don't have time for CHAKOTAY: This isn't open for discussion. I'm not turning this ship around. You're getting what you wanted. I suggest we part ways amicably. SEVEN: There is another option. We could assimilate your vessel. CHAKOTAY: If a single drone steps one millimetre out of that Cargo Bay, I'll decompress the entire deck. You won't pose much of a threat floating in space. SEVEN: When your Captain first approached us, we suspected that an agreement with humans would prove impossible to maintain. You are erratic, conflicted, disorganised. Every decision is debated. Every action questioned. Every individual entitled to their own small opinion. You lack harmony, cohesion, greatness. It will be your undoing. CHAKOTAY: Escort our guest back to the Cargo Bay. [Sickbay] CHAKOTAY: Well, I've made my decision. If it were only a matter of going against the orders of my superior officer. You're more than just my Captain, you're my friend, and I hope you'll understand. [Cargo Bay Two] BORG [OC]: Species 8472 has penetrated Matrix Zero-One-Zero, Grid Nineteen. Eight planets destroyed, three hundred twelve vessels disabled, four million, six hundred twenty-one Borg eliminated. We must seize control of the Alpha Quadrant vessel, and take it into the alien realm. SEVEN: We understand. [Bridge] PARIS: Class H moon. Oxygen-argon atmosphere. CHAKOTAY: It'll do. Take us out of warp and enter orbit. PARIS: Aye, sir. CHAKOTAY: Tuvok. Stand by to transport the Borg directly from the Cargo Bay. After they're on the surface, have Security run a sweep of KIM: I'm reading power fluctuations in the deflector array. CHAKOTAY: Cause? KIM: It looks like the Borg have accessed deflector control. They're trying to realign the emitters. CHAKOTAY: Shut them out. KIM: They've bypassed security protocols. TORRES: We're emitting a resonant gravitation beam. It's creating another singularity. CHAKOTAY: Reverse course. PARIS: We're fighting intense gravimetric distortion. I can't break free! CHAKOTAY: Bridge to Cargo Bay Two. Stop what you're doing, or I'll depressurise that deck and blow you out into space. This is your final warning. Do it! TUVOK: Decompression cycle complete. KIM: I still don't have deflector control. TUVOK: Commander, a single Borg has survived. PARIS: We're being pulled in! CHAKOTAY: Report. TUVOK: We appear to have crossed an interdimensional rift. PARIS: We've definitely left our galaxy. No stars, no planets. CHAKOTAY: Let's see. TORRES: I'm re-calibrating sensors. The entire region is filled with some kind of organic fluid. This isn't space, it's matter. SEVEN [OC]: Commander Chakotay. We have entered the domain of Species 8472. Report to the Cargo Bay. CHAKOTAY: Paris, re-pressurise Cargo Bay Two. Tuvok. [Cargo Bay Two] SEVEN: Our entry into fluidic space has created a compression wave. They know we're here. A fleet of bio-ships is already converging on our position. Time to intercept, three hours, seventeen minutes. CHAKOTAY: You've been here before. How else, could you know about fluidic space? SEVEN: We must prepare this ship for the altercation. We will construct- CHAKOTAY: Why? Why were you here? You started this war, didn't you? What's the matter. our galaxy wasn't big enough for you? You had to conquer new territory? But this race fought back. a species as malevolent as your own. SEVEN: Species 8472 was more resistant than we anticipated. Their technology is bio-genically engineered. It is superior to that of all species we have previously encountered. TUVOK: Which is precisely what you wanted. SEVEN: They are the apex of biological evolution. Their assimilation would have greatly added to our own perfection. TUVOK: So instead of assimilating these aliens you opened a door for them to our galaxy. SEVEN: There is only one course of action. Destroy them first. My subspace link to the Collective has been weakened by the interdimensional rift. We cannot signal for help. We are alone. We must construct a compliment of bio-molecular warheads and modify your weapons to launch them. CHAKOTAY: I've got a better idea. Why don't you open that singularity again and take us back. SEVEN: If I did that, you will no longer co-operate. EMH [OC]: Doctor to Chakotay. CHAKOTAY: Go ahead. EMH [OC]: Report to Sickbay at once. CHAKOTAY: On my way. [Sickbay] CHAKOTAY: Captain? EMH: As you can see, I've repaired her neural damage. Ensign Kim, the Captain, I'm two for two. JANEWAY: Doctor. if you'll excuse us a moment. EMH: Hmm? Gladly. Computer deactivate EMH Programme. JANEWAY: The Doctor brought me up to speed but he couldn't tell me what I really wanted to know. Why? CHAKOTAY: The Collective ordered me to reverse course. Travel forty light years back the way we came. What would you have done? JANEWAY: I probably would've reversed course. Maintained the alliance as long as possible. CHAKOTAY: In my mind, the alliance was already over. JANEWAY: You never trusted me. You never believed this would work. You were just waiting for an opportunity to circumvent my orders. CHAKOTAY: Trust had nothing to with it. I made a tactical decision. JANEWAY: And so did I. CHAKOTAY: They have taking advantage of us from day one. JANEWAY: We made concessions, so did they. CHAKOTAY: They lied. The Borg started the war with Species 8472. We've only got one Borg left to worry about. We should try to disable her and get back to the Delta Quadrant. We might be able to duplicate the deflector protocols they used to open a singularity. JANEWAY: No. I won't be caught tinkering with the deflector when those aliens attack. There's no other way out of this, Chakotay. It's too late for opinions, it's too late for discussion. It's time to make the call, and I'm making it. We fight the aliens in full co-operation with the Borg. CHAKOTAY: I was linked to a Collective once, remember? I had a neuro-transceiver embedded in my spine. I know who we're dealing with. We've got to get rid of that last Borg and take our chances alone. JANEWAY: It won't work. This isn't working, either. There are two wars going on. The one out there, and the one in here, and we're losing both of them. CHAKOTAY: It will be your undoing. JANEWAY: What? CHAKOTAY: Our conflicted nature. Our individuality. Seven of Nine said that we lack the cohesion of a Collective mind, that one day it would divide us and destroy us, and here we are, proving her point. JANEWAY: I'll tell you when we lost control of this situation, when we made our mistake. It was the moment we turned away from each other. We don't have to stop being individuals to get through this, we just have to stop fighting each other. [Bridge] SEVEN: Captain Janeway. JANEWAY: I've relieved Mister Chakotay of his duties and confined him to the Brig. I'm back in command. SEVEN: And you understand the situation? JANEWAY: Completely. Tuvok, give her the nanoprobes. Work with her. Build as many warheads as you can and start modifying our weapons systems. I suggest we think about enhancing our defences, as well. If we're going to fight this battle, I intend to win it. SEVEN: We are in agreement. JANEWAY: Good. This is the plan. We engage the enemy here, in their space. We show them what they're up against. If they have any sense of self-preservation, they'll back off, pull their ships out of the Delta Quadrant. That's provided the weapons are effective. If they aren't, it's been nice working with you. We've got to get this ship armed and ready in under two hours. We're going to war. KIM: Borg modifications are complete. JANEWAY: Bring them online. KIM: Torpedo launch tubes active. Hull armour engaged. Shield enhancements stable. TUVOK: Bio-molecular weapons are ready. Thirteen standard photon torpedoes and one class ten, armed with a high-yield warhead. JANEWAY: All hands, this is the Captain. Ready your stations. Seal all emergency bulkheads and prepare to engage the enemy. Stand by for my orders. PARIS: Four bio-ships have just entered sensor range. JANEWAY: Battle stations. KIM: I've got a visual. JANEWAY: On screen. KES: I can hear them. They want to talk through me. They say we've contaminated their realm. JANEWAY: Tell them we had no choice. We were only trying to defend ourselves. KES: They say our galaxy is impure. Its proximity is a threat to their genetic integrity. JANEWAY: Tell them we have a weapon. A devastating weapon that can destroy them at the cellular level. If they don't stop their attacks on the Delta Quadrant, we'll be forced to use it. KES: They said your galaxy will be purged. KIM: Shields and weapons are off-line! TUVOK: Re-routing emergency power to the launchers. PARIS: They're coming around for another assault. I've lost thrusters. TUVOK: Bio-molecular warheads are charged and ready. JANEWAY: Fire. TUVOK: Direct hit on all four vessels. No effect. KIM: They're charging weapons! TUVOK: The nanoprobes were successful, if not prompt. All four bio-ships were destroyed. JANEWAY: I think we've made our point. Now, open a singularity and get us out of here. PARIS: Captain. JANEWAY: Kes, are you still in contact? KES: Yes. JANEWAY: Tell them if they continue their attack, we'll use the weapon again. KES: They're not responding. JANEWAY: Evasive manoeuvres. PARIS: Aye Captain. They're in pursuit. JANEWAY: Prepare to fire the high-yield warhead. Aft Torpedo Bay. TUVOK: Ready, Captain. JANEWAY: Do it. TUVOK: Thirteen bio-ships have been destroyed. The others are in retreat. SEVEN: I have regained full contact with the Collective. JANEWAY: What are they saying? SEVEN: All remaining bio-ships in the Delta Quadrant are returning to their realm. The Borg have prevailed. JANEWAY: With a little help from us. Now it's time you fulfilled your end of the agreement. Tell the Collective we expect safe passage from here on out. We'll give you a shuttlecraft. You can head for the nearest Borg ship. SEVEN: Unacceptable. This alliance is terminated. Your ship and its crew will adapt to service us. Resistance is futile. KIM: Captain, she's tapping into helm control. She's trying to access our co-ordinates! JANEWAY: Shut her out. KIM: I can't. JANEWAY: Bridge to Chakotay. Scorpion. [Cargo Bay Two] CHAKOTAY [OC]: Seven of Nine, stop what you're doing. You're human, a human individual. Our minds are linked. We are one. I can hear your thoughts EMH: His link is stable, but it won't be for long. You must hurry! TORRES: Just a few more seconds. CHAKOTAY [OC]: I can see your memories. [Bridge] CHAKOTAY [OC]: You remember being human. SEVEN: We are Borg. [Cargo Bay Two] CHAKOTAY [OC]: I see a young girl, a family. [Bridge] SEVEN: Irrelevant. Your appeal to my humanity is pointless. [Cargo Bay Two] TORRES: Almost there, Chakotay. You've got to keep her distracted if we're going to make this work. CHAKOTAY [OC]: Listen to your human side, to yourself, the little girl. Seven of Nine. Annika! EMH: He's losing the link! TORRES: Initiating power surge now! [Bridge] TUVOK: Her connection to the Collective is severed. JANEWAY: Get her to Sickbay. Bridge to Doctor. Report. [Cargo Bay Two] EMH: Commander Chakotay's going to be all right, although he may wake up with a bit of a headache. [Bridge] JANEWAY: Tom, plot a course out of Borg space. Maximum warp. PARIS: Yes, Ma'am. Captain's Log, Stardate 51003.7. Three days, and no sign of Borg or bio-ships. We appear to be out of danger, but the entire crew is still on edge and so am I. Not even the calm of Master Da Vinci's workshop is enough to ease my mind. [Da Vinci's Workshop - night] CHAKOTAY: Am I interrupting? JANEWAY: Not at all. Just finishing up my Log. CHAKOTAY: The old-fashioned way. JANEWAY: I wanted to get as far away from bio-implants and fluidic space, and this feels more human somehow. CHAKOTAY: I hate to spoil the mood, but you might want to look at this Engineering report. It'll take at least two weeks to remove the Borg technology from our systems. B'Elanna did note that the power couplings on deck eight work better with the Borg improvements. JANEWAY: Leave them. How is our passenger? CHAKOTAY: The Doctor says she's stabilising. Her human cells are starting to regenerate. JANEWAY: I wonder what's left under all that Borg technology. If she can ever become human again. CHAKOTAY: You plan to keep her on board. JANEWAY: We pulled the plug. We're responsible for what happens to her now. CHAKOTAY: She was assimilated at a very young age. The Collective's all she knows. She might not want to stay. JANEWAY: I think she might. We have one thing the Borg could never offer. Friendship. CHAKOTAY: I want you to know that disobeying your orders was one of the most difficult things I've ever had to do. JANEWAY: I understand, and I respect the decision you made even though I disagree with it. What's important is that in the end, we got through this together. I don't ever want that to change. CHAKOTAY: Agreed. JANEWAY: Good. Well, I think it's time we get back to our bridge. CHAKOTAY: No argument there. Star Trek ® is copyright of CBS Studios INC.

       "\"Title: Before And After Stardate: 50601.9 Original Airdate: 9th April, 1997 EMH [OC]: Activate the bio-temporal chamber. [Sickbay, 2379] ANDREW: Is she going to be all right? EMH: Not if you don't all clear out of here and let me do my work. LINNIS: She's my mother. I'm staying. EMH: This is a very delicate procedure, and I could use some peace and quiet. KIM: The Doctor's right. Let him do his work. LINNIS: All right. EMH: I wish I'd told you this before, but better late than never. You're the finest friend I've ever had. Prepare to bring the bio-temporal chamber online. We'll begin in approximately five minutes. ANDREW: Grandma? Are you awake? I brought you a present. Grandma Kes? I finally finished your birthday present. Sorry it's late, but I wanted to get it right. KES: I don't know you. ANDREW: What do you mean? I'm Andrew, your grandson. KES: I don't know you. ANDREW: Doctor? Doctor Van Gogh? EMH: What is it? ANDREW: She doesn't recognise me. EMH: Kes? How are you feeling? KES: Where am I? What is this place? EMH: You're in Sickbay. Do you know who I am? KES: No. Yes, I've seen you before. EMH: Do you know my name? KES: The boy, he called you Doctor Van Gogh. EMH: That's right. KES: You said I was your finest friend. EMH: Well, I'm not sure I've ever said that, exactly, but, that doesn't mean it's not true. KES: How could I be your friend? I don't know you. EMH: Tell me what you do remember. KES: Er, people around me. Crowded around me. You, the boy, a young girl. I was in a chamber, a bio-temporal chamber. EMH: Good. KES: I was inside it and you told someone to activate it. EMH: I'm afraid you're confused. I discussed the bio-temporal chamber with you, but we're not ready to put you inside it just yet. Can you recall anything else, besides those people you saw? Anything else about your life? KES: No. EMH: Go find the rest of your family. CHAKOTAY: Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's the big hurry? ANDREW: I'm sorry, Captain, I have to go. CHAKOTAY: What was that all about? EMH: I'm afraid Kes is getting worse, Captain. Her amnesia is near total. Fewer than one percent of her engrams remain intact. It's as if her memory were wiped clean. CHAKOTAY: Is it some sort of senility? EMH: Maybe. I've never treated a nine year old Ocampan before. For all I know, it's a perfectly normal part of their aging process. CHAKOTAY: It's hard to believe that she performed micro-surgery on my elbow just a few weeks ago. EMH: A few weeks ago she was a healthy woman, but this morilogium comes on abruptly and then progresses with a rapidity I've never seen before. CHAKOTAY: How are you coming along with the bio-temporal chamber? EMH: As I told you, it's a completely revolutionary procedure. I have no idea if it'll work. Under normal circumstances I'd want to perform extensive tests on the apparatus, but we're losing her too fast. If I don't try it now it may be too late. CHAKOTAY: If you really believe it will prolong her life? EMH: If we're lucky it may buy her another year. CHAKOTAY: I think you have the family's consent. You should go ahead and do it. KES: So cold. I'm cold. EMH: No wonder. Your temperature has dropped to 14.8, almost two degrees below normal. CHAKOTAY: What does that mean? EMH: I'm not sure. CHAKOTAY? What? EMH: Her cells are in a state of bio-temporal flux. I don't understand how that could be happening before I put her in the chamber. KES: I'm cold. [Kes's quarters] ANDREW: Look mom, I'm almost finished with Grandma's present. LINNIS: It's wonderful, sweetheart. I'm sure Grandma will think it was well worth the wait. ANDREW: I hope so. I still feel bad for not having it ready in time for her party. LINNIS: Hello. How was your nap? KES: Andrew? ANDREW: Grandma, don't look. You'll spoil the surprise. LINNIS: Why don't you sit down. I'll get you some tea. KES: Where am I? LINNIS: In your quarters. KES: What quarters? LINNIS: Aboard Voyager. What's wrong? KES: I don't know who you are. But you, I know who you are. Tell me what's happening. How did I get here? LINNIS: Andrew, get your grandfather and father. Tell them to meet us in Sickbay. KES: Yes, Sickbay. I remember that place. I was just there. LINNIS: When? KES: Just a few minutes ago. Doctor Van Gogh asked me some questions. I couldn't remember anything. LINNIS: You haven't been to sickbay for over a week, since you stopped working there. KES: Working? What kind of work? LINNIS: Don't you remember? You were one of the ship's doctors. I worked there with you. KES: Who are you? LINNIS: I'm your daughter, Linnis. [Corridor] KES: But I don't remember you. LINNIS: Do you remember anything at all? KES: Just people crowded around me. Voices. The Doctor told everyone to leave and then he told someone else to activate the bio-temporal chamber. LINNIS: He's been working on that. He may have mentioned it to you. KES: And then I woke up and there was a boy, Andrew, standing over me with a present, calling me Grandma. LINNIS: Andrew hasn't finished your present yet. You just saw him still working on it in your quarters. KES: But he was there! The Doctor sent him to get my family, and I was cold and I woke up in that bed in the quarters, and LINNIS: Maybe you were dreaming. KES: I don't think so. LINNIS: Well, none of the things you remember before waking from your nap have happened. KES: How do you know? LINNIS: Listen to me, mother. You're confused right now and I'm sure that's very frightening, but you need to trust me. I'm your daughter and I love you. Now please, come with me. Come. [Sickbay] EMH: I've been expecting this. LINNIS: The onset of morilogium. EMH: She's lost more than ninety eight percent of her memory engrams. KES: Morilogium? LINNIS: The final phase of the Ocampan lifespan, mother. KES: Are you saying that I'm dying? EMH: Not if l can help it. LINNIS: What do you mean? PARIS: Kes, it's me, Tom. Your husband. EMH: Tom, we're losing her. PARIS: How long? EMH: If we do nothing, a matter of weeks. But I'm working on something to extend her lifespan. It involves treating her with a bio-temporal field in order to push her cells back to an earlier stage of entropic decay. It's highly experimental, but if it works it might buy her some time. LINNIS: No. My mother's always accepted that she would only live nine years. If she's reaching the natural end of her life she wouldn't want extraordinary measures taken to extend it. Especially not in the state she's in now. PARIS: If the Doctor has a way to keep your mother with us, even for one more day, we have to let him try. LINNIS: We're not talking about a tested medical procedure here, we're talking about a radical experiment! KIM: Sweetheart, l understand how upsetting this is, but if it were you on that biobed I'd feel just like Tom does. KES: Everyone listen to me, please. ANDREW: Yes, listen to her. LINNIS: Mother, tell us what you want. KES: I want to know what's going on here. Maybe the morilogium is causing my amnesia, but that doesn't explain how l seem to suddenly jump from sickbay to my quarters, or how l remember being in a bio temporal chamber. EMH: Kes, it's possible the morilogium is causing you to experience delusions. KES: No! They're not delusions. EMH: I want you to lie down. KES: No. ANDREW: Leave her alone. KIM: Your grandmother's very sick, son. ANDREW: Maybe, but she's not delusional. She's the smartest person I know! You should listen to her. KES: I'm cold. EMH: Her body temperature has dropped two point seven degrees. [Mess hall] ALL [singing]: For she's a jolly good fellow, for she's a jolly good fellow, for she's a jolly good fellow, which nobody can deny. NEELIX: Happy ninth, Kes. Go ahead, make a wish. Well, what are you waiting for? Blow out the candles. It's good to see that old lung is still working, Kessie. PARIS: Happy birthday, sweetheart. NEELIX: Well, you know, I haven't made one of these since, well since I became security officer. TUVOK: Perhaps you would care to relinquish your commission and return to the scene of your former triumphs. NEELIX: You keep working on that sense of humour, Commander Vulcan. You'll get it one of these days. Jibelian fudge, your favourite. Some of us ought to be watching our calories, but after all, it is a special occasion. KES: Andrew. ANDREW: I'm sorry I don't have a present for you, grandma. I've got an idea for something special I'm going to make, but I've been too busy with school work, I haven't had a chance to start it. KES: I think it'll be worth the wait. Come and talk to grandma for a minute, will you? ANDREW: Sure. KES: I'm going to ask you a few questions and I want you to think very carefully before you answer them, all right? ANDREW: I always think before I speak. You taught me that. KES: Where were you before you came to this party? ANDREW: At my physics lesson in engineering. KES: And then you came directly here? ANDREW: No, I stopped at your quarters to get you. Don't you remember? EMH: Andrew, stop monopolising your grandmother's time. There are other people who'd like to wish her happy birthday, you know. ANDREW: She's all yours, Doctor. Excuse me. That cake looks great. EMH: It's amazing to think that you weren't even a year old when we first met. Not much older than Andrew. KES: Doctor, there's something wrong with me. EMH: What is it? KES: Promise to hear me out and not assume I'm delusional. EMH: Why do you think I'd ever make such an assumption? KES: Promise! EMH: Of course. KES: I've lost all but a few of my memories, and the memories I do have don't coincide with anyone else's. EMH: Can you be more specific? KES: Well, I was in sickbay, and you and a woman, my daughter were arguing about prolonging my life. And then I suddenly appeared in my quarters and then I simply appeared here. EMH: As far as I know, none of that happened. Is it possible you were dreaming? KES: No. I was awake, I'm sure of it. But nobody else remembers the things I do. EMH: I hate to say this, but it's possible these strange experiences you're having are related to the onset of the morilogium. KES: You talked about that. You wanted to put me in a bio-temporal chamber to stop my aging process. EMH: How could you possibly know about that? KES: Because you told me. EMH: I only came up with the idea for the bio-temporal chamber this morning. I was going to tell you about it today, here at the party, as a sort of birthday surprise. KES: If that were true, then how could I already know about it. EMH: I don't know, but we'd better get you to sickbay and find out. [Sickbay] EMH: She appears to have lost more than ninety five percent of her memory engrams. PARIS: Is that symptomatic of the morilogium? EMH: I don't know. I have no basis for comparison, no other Ocampans on board. PARIS: Don't worry, we'll get to the bottom of this. KES: I do have memories, they just don't coincide with anyone else's. First Andrew gave me a belated birthday present, then he said he was working on the present, and now he just apologised for not starting it yet. PARIS: It's almost as if you're experiencing events in reverse. CHAKOTAY: Maybe there's some kind of time paradox at work. EMH: There is another possibility. Given that Kes has knowledge of a treatment I have not yet devised, it's possible she's developed some sort of precognition. KES: Are you saying I can see into the future? PARIS: Well you've demonstrated some pretty extraordinary mental powers over the years. Telepathy, telekinesis. EMH: And precognition wouldn't be unprecedented. Some species, including the Yattho of the Beta quadrant, have been known to predict future events with uncanny accuracy. CHAKOTAY: See if you can confirm this theory about precognition. In the meantime, Tom and I will be scanning for temporal anomalies. PARIS: We'll do everything we can to help you. KES: I'd like to do something to help myself. CHAKOTAY: What did you have in mind? KES: Well I seem to have lived quite a full life on this ship. Maybe if I have a look in my medical files, or check other record of my activities, I might be able to fill in some of the blanks. EMH: Well you may have lost your memories, but you certainly haven't lost your determination. [Kes's quarters] PARIS: Hi. KES: Oh, hello. PARIS: How's it coming? KES: I've had a busy life. It's hard to know where to start. How about you? PARIS: Well, we've tried every kind of temporal scan Harry could think of, but we still haven't been able to find anything to explain what's been happening to you. Your initial physical exam. I remember when you came on board. I had a crush on you right from the beginning. I tried to hide it, but Neelix sensed it and boy, was he ever jealous. KES: Neelix? PARIS: You don't remember. You and he were involved for quite a while. One of your prenatal exams. We listened to Linnis's heartbeat. That was quite a day. KES: What about this. It says I got some kind of radiation poisoning on stardate 50973. PARIS: That was the beginning of the year of hell. KES: Year of hell? PARIS: That's what some of us call it now. We were under virtually constant attack by a race called the Krenim. The ship almost didn't make it. The Doctor was offline for months, and we lost a lot of good people. Captain Janeway, Joe Carey, B'Elanna. KES: B'Elanna. PARIS: I keep forgetting that you don't remember any of them. B'Elanna was someone who was very special to me. When she died, I felt like I wanted to die too, but you, you helped me through it. I'm sorry. KES: No, no, it's my fault. You haven't done anything wrong. It's just PARIS: You don't remember any of our life together. Well, that's all right. I've got enough feelings for both of us. KES: Maybe the feelings I had for you will come back. PARIS: You were asking about the radiation poisoning. A lot of us were exposed. During the first Krenim attack one of the chroniton torpedo fragments leaked radiation into the ship. KES: Chroniton torpedoes? PARIS: They were able to penetrate our shields because their torpedoes were in a constant state of temporal flux. Wait a minute. Think we may be onto something. We'd better go talk to the Doctor. Come on. [Corridor] KES: If I was infected with these chroniton particles, then there might be a connection to what's happening to me now. PARIS: Exactly. KES: Maybe we should try scanning for residual [Kes's quarters - 2378] KIM: Say cheese! LINNIS: I think he's got your nose, mother. KIM: So how does it feel to be a grandfather? PARIS: A lot better than it does to have you for a son-in-law. KES: What's the date? PARIS: The date? KES: Yes, the stardate. KIM: It's 56947. Why? KES: Over six months. LINNIS: Mother, what's going on? KES: Tom, we have to talk to the Doctor. Come on. [Sickbay] KES: As far as I can tell I've jumped backwards a total of five times so far. EMH: Is there any discernable pattern to these jumps? KES: No, they're apparently random. One time it seemed to span for a few weeks, and the last was half a year. Each time I arrive I seem to exist in temporal synch with the rest of you for a while, but before I can make anyone understand what's happening I find myself in am earlier time of my life. And just before it happens I seem to experience a sudden drop in body temperature. EMH: Hmm. Now this could explain a thing or two. KES: What is it? EMH: I'm detecting high level chroniton radiation in your cells. KES: So I was right. There is a connection. PARIS: But Kes was inoculated along with the rest of the crew over three years ago. EMH: Yes. However, everyone was left with trace amounts of the radiation in their bodies. For some reason those residual chronitons have reactivated in Kes. PARIS: Why? KES: The bio-temporal chamber. EMH: My thinking exactly. PARIS: Would you two mind explaining? EMH: It's really quite obvious, Lieutenant. Your wife is travelling backward through time. KES: It's as though I came into existence at the moment of my own death, without any memories. I've been living my life backwards ever since, jumping progressively to earlier moments in my life. accumulating memories and experiences as I go. Your past has become my future. CHAKOTAY: Doctor, any theory about what's causing this? EMH: In approximately six months, I will apparently expose Kes to some type of bio-temporal field in a highly experimental but nonetheless brilliant attempt to stop her aging process. TUVOK: And it's this attempt which leads to Kes's current predicament. EMH: What I will apparently fail to realise is that the bio-temporal field is going to reactivate the dormant chroniton particles in her cells, bringing Kes out of temporal synch with the rest of us. CHAKOTAY: Is there any way to stop Kes from continuing these jumps? EMH: Yes. Purge her completely of the chroniton poisoning. KIM: To do that we'd need to know the precise temporal variance of the specific torpedo which contaminated the ship. TUVOK: Tactical sensors were not functioning at the time. There is no data regarding the torpedo in question. PARIS: Let me get one thing straight, Doc. Is it possible if this keeps happening to Kes that she might actually jump back into a time before she knew any of us? EMH: Worse than that, Mister Paris, it's possible she may eventually jump back to a time before she even existed. CHAKOTAY [OC]: Captain's log, stardate 55836.2. Kes has remained in temporal synch with us for two days now, but since we don't know when she may jump again, we can't afford to rest until we've found some way to help her. [Medical Laboratory] LINNIS: I'm going to try running a hypothalamic scan. Maybe we can establish a pattern to the drops in your body temperature. KES: You're very good at this, aren't you. LINNIS: I had a very good teacher. KES: Doctor Van Gogh? LINNIS: You. KES: I'm sorry, all this must be taking you away from your baby just now. You must be wanting to spend every second with him. LINNIS: Actually I feel a little awkward around him sometimes. Harry's always singing to him and playing with him, but, well, I seem to be much more comfortable with a molecular scanner than I am with a diaper. KES: Now Linnis, I don't think it's EMH: Kes, I may have found a way to prevent your next jump. I've erected a containment field that may keep you here. It's going to require your confinement in sickbay. LINNIS: I'll keep working here. KES: Linnis, you must be a good mother. I happen to know that Andrew grows up to be a wonderful child. [Sickbay] KES: Hello, Tom. PARIS: I thought maybe you could use some company. KES: I feel like I'm in a cage. Doctor Van Gogh says PARIS: Doctor Van Gogh? I thought you settled on Mozart. EMH: Evidently my interest in the great figures of art and culture will be an ongoing process. PARIS: Well, Vincent, how about letting me inside this thing? EMH: I'm afraid that wouldn't be advisable. PARIS: Okay then, how about another installment of Tom and Kes, the Early Years. KES: I'd enjoy that. PARIS: Well, there was our wedding reception. Harry was my best man. He got so nervous when he stood up to give the toast that he spilt champagne all over my dress uniform. KES: What is it? PARIS: At the time, I thought that was the happiest day of my life, but every day just got better and better. KES: Oh, it means so much to have you here now. LINNIS: I think I may have found something. EMH: What is it. LINNIS: I was studying the effects of the chronitons on other crew members and PARIS: What's that? EMH: Kes's temperature has dropped one point nine degrees. Linnis, monitor the containment field. I'm going to try to elevate her temperature. Her temperature's still dropping. LINNIS: We're losing containment. EMH: Increase the field amplitude. PARIS: Kes? LINNIS: It's not working. EMH: We're losing her. Set field polarization to maximum! PARIS: Do something! [Shuttlecraft - 2374] PARIS: The sac is opening. KES: What's happening? PARIS: What do you mean, what's happening? You're having a baby. Hold still. KES: Where am I? PARIS: Exactly where I told you not to be, on a shuttlecraft. KES: I have to see the Doctor. PARIS: Well, that'd be nice if he were still around. I told you you were in no condition to come on a supply mission, but did you listen to me? I can see the toes, it's coming. Yes! It's a girl! Ah, she's beautiful. KES: Yes, she is. PARIS: Yes, just like her mother. KES: Tom, listen. PARIS: I love you, Kes. KES: We need to talk. PARIS: Just a minute. KES: What is it? PARIS: Voyager's under attack. [Corridor] NEELIX: Congratulations. PARIS: Thanks, but it looks like the celebration will have to wait. NEELIX: I'll get Kes and the baby to the mess hall. Captain Chakotay wants you to go to the weapons array and modulate the targeting scanners to a parametric frequency. He's going to try to knock out the chroniton torpedo launchers before they're fired. KES: Chroniton torpedoes. The Year of Hell. PARIS: What? KES: You told me that the crew referred to this time as the Year of Hell. PARIS: When did I tell you that? KES: It's a long story. PARIS: You'll have to tell me later. I've got to get to the weapons array. Neelix, get her to lie down, will you? KES: Neelix, listen very carefully. There's something very important I have to tell you. [Mess hall] PARIS: Neelix told us what's been happening to you, Kes. How are you holding up? KES: We're both fine. CHAKOTAY: That's quite a story. KES: Just before the last jump we were close to a solution. The Doctor was working on PARIS: The Doctor? CHAKOTAY: Well it's good to know we'll eventually get him back online. PARIS: Eventually may be too late. We've got to help Kes now. KES: We discovered that what's been happening to me is related to the chroniton poisoning I suffered during a Krenim attack. We have to determine the exact temporal variance of the torpedo, so that CHAKOTAY: Main computer's been off line for weeks. Even if the sensor logs contain that information, we can't access them. KES: You have to put me in the bio-temporal containment field. I know it didn't work last time, but with a few modifications CHAKOTAY: We've only got life support on three out of fourteen decks, and we've had to divert all remaining power to knock out the Krenim's torpedo launchers. We don't even have the sickbay anymore, much less the resources to create a bio-containment field. I'm sorry. PARIS: We've got to do something to help her. CHAKOTAY: I'm open to suggestions. KES: I'm cold. PARIS: I'll get you a blanket. KES: No, you don't understand, I'm about, I'm about [Holodeck - Paxau Resort] KES: Tom. PARIS: Hey, Kes, some party, huh? KES: I have to talk to you. TORRES: Tom, I'm sorry I'm late. KES: You must be B'Elanna. TORRES: Well, the last time I checked. PARIS: Something wrong? KES: Actually, there is something wrong. JANEWAY [OC]: Red alert. All hands to battle stations. [Bridge] JANEWAY: Tuvok, fire phasers! TUVOK: Acknowledged. CHAKOTAY: Who the hell are they? KES: They're called the Krenim. JANEWAY: How do you know that? KES: Captain Janeway? JANEWAY: What is it, Kes. What do you know about them? TUVOK: Shields down to thirty nine percent, Captain. CHAKOTAY: I don't understand how these torpedoes are ripping right through our shields. JANEWAY: Evasive manoeuvres, Mister Paris. B'Elanna, can we reroute power to the forward shields? TORRES: Already trying. KES: Captain, these torpedoes are chroniton based. They're passing through our shields because they're in a state of temporal flux. (engineering console explodes) They're dead. PARIS: B'Elanna! KIM: Hull breach on deck seven. We're losing life support. CHAKOTAY: Evacuate the deck. Tom, I need you at the conn. PARIS: Aye sir. TUVOK: Commander, they're arming their torpedo launchers again. We cannot sustain another direct hit. CHAKOTAY: Kes, you seem to know something about these weapons. Do you have any idea how we can stop them? KES: I'm not sure, but I think it has something to do with remodulating the targeting scanners. KIM: That could work. If we remodulate the scanners to a parametric frequency we might be able to destroy the torpedo launchers before they fire. CHAKOTAY: Mister Tuvok, you heard the man. Tom, bring us about. TUVOK: Ready, Commander. CHAKOTAY: Fire! [Mess hall] CHAKOTAY: Do you have a casualty report? KIM: Including Captain Janeway and B'Elanna, we lost eleven people. CHAKOTAY: What about the ship? KIM: Starboard shield generators and warp drive are offline, and power is down on decks four through twelve. CHAKOTAY: Make deck five your priority. We've got to get sickbay up and running again. KIM: Aye sir. CHAKOTAY: Kes, as far as what you say is happening to you KES: I understand my condition can't be a priority now. CHAKOTAY: Tom, I'm going to need you to stay here and treat these people. When this is over we're all going to have a lot of grieving to do. KES: How are you doing? Tom, I know it doesn't seem possible now, but you're going to be all right. PARIS: I wish I could believe you. KES: You can. PARIS: Thanks. NEELIX: Kes, we've got radiation leakage coming from one of the Krenim torpedo fragments. People are starting to complain of nausea. KES: Chroniton radiation. This is it. I'm infected. Where's the radiation coming from? NEELIX: It's lodged in a Jefferies tube on deck eleven, section two. KES: I've got to get down there. NEELIX: You can't, the entire deck is sealed off. KES: I have to find the exact temporal variance of that torpedo. NEELIX: You can't go near that thing, you'll be burnt to a crisp. KES: I know what I'm doing. You stay here and help Tom, all right? NEELIX: Yes, but [Sickbay - 2373] EMH: Kes, how are you coming with those analgesic compounds? KES: Doctor, you've lost your hair. EMH: I beg your pardon? KES: It's a long story. The important thing is, the temporal variance of the chroniton torpedo was one point four seven microseconds. [Briefing room] KES: So I've determined I've jumped a total of six years into my past. TUVOK: Do you have any theory as to the cause of these jumps? EMH: According to Kes, she and the rest of the crew will be infected by chroniton radiation in approximately eleven months from now. Everyone will be inoculated and the effects will appear to vanish. However, some five years later, when I attempt an experimental and, I might add, ingenious procedure to extend her lifespan, the bio-temporal field I expose her to will trigger dormant chroniton particles, taking Kes out of temporal synch and causing her to begin her backward journey through time. JANEWAY: In all my years in Starfleet I've never come across a phenomenon quite like this. EMH: Kes has been able to provide us with the precise temporal variance of the torpedo which infected her. TORRES: Since Kes is moving backward in time, she's already been infected by the radiation poisoning. If we can set up a bio-temporal chamber and expose her to a precisely modulated field of anti-chroniton particles, we feel this may purge her system and bring her back into temporal synch with there rest of us. JANEWAY: Well, we'd better get moving. For all we know, Kes's next jump will take her back to a time when we're not here to help her. KES: Captain, there's something else I have to tell you. In about six months you're going to enter a region of space controlled by a race called the Krenim. You must avoid them at all costs. JANEWAY: Tell me more. [Sickbay] TORRES: I'm ready to bring the chamber online. JANEWAY: Synaptic relays are operational. How are her vital signs? EMH: Pulse normal, body temperature fourteen degrees, chroniton level at seventy nine roentgens. Go ahead and activate the chamber, Lieutenant. Increase the bio-temporal field stress. TORRES: Bringing field stress to twenty five kilodynes. EMH: Alright, let's try the anti-chronitons. TORRES: Whenever you're ready, Doc. EMH: Initiating anti-chroniton burst, ten mev's, five second pulse. Pulse steady, body temperature at fourteen point two degrees, and rising. JANEWAY: What about her chroniton count? EMH: Chroniton count is seventy one roentgens and dropping. JANEWAY: It's working. EMH: Lieutenant Torres, increase the field strength to thirty kilodynes. TORRES: Right. EMH: Initiating another burst/. Fifteen mev's, five second pulse. Body temperature fourteen point nine degrees, chroniton count sixty eight roentgens, sixty, fifty seven, fifty two. [Ready room - 2371] NEELIX: You need a cook. You haven't lived until you've tasted my angla'bosque. It will be my job to anticipate your needs before you know you have them. KES: Not again. NEELIX: And I anticipate your first need will be me. KES: I'm sorry, I know this is going to sound strange to you both, but I don't belong here. NEELIX: But we discussed this. KES: You don't understand, I'm travelling backwards in time, getting younger. We have to lower my chroniton levels. You've got to get me into the bio-temporal chamber right away. NEELIX: I, I, I'm sorry Captain. I didn't quite anticipate this. KES: Listen to me, please. NEELIX: Sweeting, try to calm down. I assure you, Captain, she's never behaved this way before. JANEWAY: Hold on a minute, Mister Neelix. Kes, why don't you start over, slowly. KES: It begins about eight years in the future, when I'm about to die. No! [Ocampa - 2370] BENAREN: Time for dinner. What's wrong, Kes. YOUNG KES: Who are you? What is this place? BENAREN: We don't have time to play our guessing game right now, Kes. You know how your mother gets when we're late to the table. YOUNG KES: You're my father. BENAREN: That's right, and you're my favourite daughter, but don't tell anyone. YOUNG KES: Listen to me, something terrible's been happening to me. BENAREN: What's wrong? YOUNG KES: There might not be much time so I've got to explain this quickly. Please try to believe me. I've been living aboard a starship called Voyager. BENAREN: A starship. I see. So now it's not only the surface you're dreaming about exploring. YOUNG KES: Listen to me. I did go to the surface, or rather, I will go there, and the people aboard the ship are going to rescue me from the Kazon. BENARAN: We can talk about your adventures after dinner. YOUNG KES: No, there's no time. You've got to believe me. One moment I was this old woman and then, and then BENARAN: Kes, we're late. YOUNG KES: Father, please. [Ocampa Medical Centre] BENARAN: I can see the toes! Keep going, Martis. It's a girl. MARTIS: Oh, Kes. BENARAN: It's a girl. MARTIS: Oh, she's so, she's so beautiful. Kes. I think one day she'll see the sun. [Sickbay - 2373] EMH: Fifty one roentgens, forty six, thirty four. Another anti-chroniton burst, twenty mev's. TORRES: Right. EMH: Levels are continuing to drop. Pulse normal, body temperature steady at sixteen point three, chroniton levels are at zero roentgens. Welcome back, Kes. KES: What's the date? How old am I? EMH: The same age you were when we put you into the bio-temporal chamber. A healthy three years and two months. And due to an extraordinary display of medical heroics, you're back in temporal synch with the rest of us. [Holodeck - Paxau resort] NEELIX: So, I'm going to become a security officer. How about that? TUVOK: Fortunately, Mister Neelix, what Kes has been describing is merely one possible future. On each occasion that she jumped to a previous time, her subsequent actions most likely altered the future from that moment on. NEELIX: Good point, Tuvok. Maybe I'll turn out to be Chief Security Officer. KIM: So, Kes, have you regained all your memories of the past? KES: I remember last month's supply of replicator rations that you borrowed, that you owe me, if that's what you're asking. KIM: Don't worry, I haven't forgotten. EMH: I realise it's only hypothetical, but still I'd be curious to know what sorts of medical break-throughs I'm going to make in this possible future. KES: It's not as if I've seen everything that's going to happen over the next six years. I only remember short periods I experienced between jumps. TORRES: Even so, I bet you found out some pretty interesting things. PARIS: Yeah, Kes. Tell us what you know. CHAKOTAY: Careful, Tom. You may find out that you leave Voyager only to join a monastery. KIM: Give him a little credit. I bet he gets married and has a family. PARIS: Thank you. KIM: Don't mention it. TORRES: Are you telling? KES: Well, as Tuvok said, I've only seen pieces of one possible future. PARIS: You know what? Don't tell me. I don't wanna know. I like a little mystery in my life. JANEWAY: Tom's right. I think we should all leave the future to the future. TUVOK: While I agree it would not be wise for Kes to make all of her experiences public, a report on anything she knows about these Krenim might be useful. KES: I'll get started right away. JANEWAY: Hang on a minute. I didn't mean now. Stay and enjoy your party. KES: If there's one thing that this experience has taught me, Captain, it's that there's no time like the present.

       "\"Title: Rise Stardate: 50567.4 Original Airdate:26 February, 1997 [Bridge] JANEWAY: Fire! TUVOK: The asteroid is fragmenting, but most of the debris is still on a collision course with the planet. JANEWAY: Target the fragments. Destroy them. CHAKOTAY: That asteroid should have been vaporised. What happened? KIM: Not sure. Sensors showed a simple nickel-iron composition. We shouldn't be seeing fragments more than a centimetre in diameter. SKLAR: Ambassador, I'm afraid I was right. This isn't going to work. The same thing happened to us yesterday. We tried to vaporize two incoming asteroids but they fragmented and struck the surface. TUVOK: I've destroyed most of the debris, Captain, however targeting scanners were unable to track two of the fragments. They have already entered the upper atmosphere. The debris impacted on the largest continent, approximately 500 kilometres from the southern tip. NEZU AMBASSADOR: The central desert. Fortunately that region isn't heavily populated. TUVOK: Substantial cratering, atmospheric shockwaves, and large concentrations of dust and other stratospheric contaminants. SKLAR: How long until the next asteroid hits? TUVOK: Approximately six hours. NEZU AMBASSADOR: Can you give us an idea of it's trajectory? TUVOK: Same continent, but this time on the eastern coastal region. NEZU AMBASSADOR: Our largest colonies are there. Over five thousand citizens. SKLAR: Captain. We appreciate your efforts but I think it's time we considered an evacuation. According to my analysis there are at least twelve more asteroids heading in our direction. How can we hope to destroy them all even with your help? KIM: Incoming hail from the surface. It's coming from one of the heavily damaged areas. JANEWAY: On screen. VATM [on viewscreen]: Ambassador, I've been analysing the debris and I've discovered disturbing evidence that the asteroids are not what they seem. They are composed of artificial materials. I must meet with you immediately. KIM: I've lost the transmission. CHAKOTAY: Location? KIM: I can't find him. Too much interference. NEZU AMBASSADOR: That was Doctor Vatm, our most prominent astrophysicist. He mentioned the composition of the asteroids. Could he have found something important? SKLAR: At this point Ambassador, I don't know what that discovery could be. JANEWAY: Mister Paris, can we send a shuttle down through that turbulence? PARIS: It would be a rough ride, but I think it's possible. SKLAR: Our chances of finding Doctor Vatm are slim. We should evacuate the colonies. NEZU AMBASSADOR: We haven't time to evacuate all those people. I won't give up, not now. Captain, I'm asking for your help again., but I won't ask you to risk your crew. JANEWAY: In for a penny, in for a pound. NEZU AMBASSADOR: Excuse me? JANEWAY: It's a human expression, Ambassador, and it means we're not leaving you now. Tuvok, assemble rescue teams. We'll send down three shuttles to find Doctor Vatm. TUVOK: Aye Captain. Mister Paris. CHAKOTAY: Bridge to Engineering. B'Elanna, I want you to beam aboard a sample of the debris from that last asteroid. Let's find out why it wasn't vaporised. JANEWAY: I'm going to study the data we've collected so far. I'll be in my Ready Room. [Sickbay] NEELIX: I need analeptic compounds. EMH: Are you ill? NEELIX: No, I'm feeling quite vigorous. I requested a place on the rescue team as part of my starfleet training and the Captain said yes, so I thought it might be useful to bring along a few extra medical supplies. KES: We have some analeptic compounds in the bio-lab. I'll get them for you. EMH: May I suggest a tranquillizer? NEELIX: No, no, no, I'll be fine. Just that I'm a little apprehensive. I've been assigned to Lieutenant Tuvok's team and no matter what I do I can't seem to please him. EMH: Vulcan's are notoriously difficult to impress. Mister Tuvok seldom acknowledges my brilliance. A word of advice, Mister Neelix. Try to restrain your enthusiasm. You're there to observe and learn. NEELIX: Good advice, Doctor. [Shuttlecraft] TUVOK: Altitude fifteen kilometres, velocity mach two point one. Entering upper troposphere. NEELIX: Mister Sklar, are you all right? SKLAR: I'm an exo-geologist. I prefer working on the ground. NEELIX: We'll be landing shortly. Try to relax. SKLAR: Oh, oh, what's happening? TUVOK: We're entering a layer of electro-dynamic turbulence. Full power to thrusters. NEELIX: Thrusters aren't responding. TUVOK: Attempting to level our descent. NEELIX: We're losing main power. TUVOK: I'll have to land the shuttle manually. Brace for impact. [Bridge] KIM: Commander, I've lost contact with Tuvok's shuttle. CHAKOTAY: Hail them. KIM: No response. CHAKOTAY: Notify Lieutenant Paris and the others we may have a team down. TORRES [OC]: Torres to bridge. CHAKOTAY: Go ahead. [Engineering] TORRES: We've beamed aboard a piece of the debris. [Bridge] CHAKOTAY: I'll be right there. Ambassador? [Shuttlecraft] TUVOK: Doctor Vatm. VATM: I heard what sounded like a ship crashing. I came looking for you. This is Hanjuan, he's a miner at the nearby gallacite excavation. He heard your ship too. TUVOK: Have you seen any other vessels like ours? VATM: No, just you. SKLAR: Doctor, you said you had information on the composition of the asteroids. What is it? VATM: That data is classified. I can only speak to the Ambassador. TUVOK: You may also speak to me. Your Ambassador sent us to find you. VATM: No. I prefer to wait. SKLAR: Doctor, we almost died trying to get that information. Tell us. VATM: Be silent, Sklar! NEELIX: Now gentlemen, there's no point in arguing. Right now we have to get this shuttle off the ground. TUVOK: Unfortunately that will not be possible. All primary systems are off-line. Warp drive and impulse engines have been destroyed. I suggest we repair the comm. system and send a distress call. HANJUAN: How long will that take? TUVOK: Several hours at least. SKLAR: We don't have several hours. When the next asteroid hits, it could destroy this entire region. We've got to get out of here soon! TUVOK: I assure you we're doing everything we can. Mister Neelix, please go outside and inspect the toroidal antennae. I need to know if any of the signal relays were damaged. NEELIX: If they were, I can try to repair them. TUVOK: A damage report will be sufficient. NEELIX: I've been studying with Lieutenant Torres. She gave me a full orientation on shuttlecraft systems. TUVOK: Damage report, Mister Neelix. NEELIX: Aye sir. TUVOK: In the meantime, I suggest everyone try to remain calm. Allowing anxiety to overcome you will only hinder the efficiency of our efforts. NEELIX: He's really a very pleasant fellow, once you get to know him. And intelligent. I'm sure he'll have the comm. system up and running TUVOK: Neelix. NEELIX: On my way. SKLAR: Why won't you share the data with NEELIX: Excuse me! Mister Tuvok. TUVOK: You couldn't have finished already. NEELIX: Not exactly. What I mean to say is, I know I'm here to observe, and I don't mean to step out of line, but I think I've observed a way of here. HANJUAN: Where? NEELIX: I saw what appeared to be an orbital tether anchored nearby. VATM: Yes, we use those to lift cargo from the surface to the orbital supply station. NEELIX: May I assume it uses magnetic leverage to lift the carriage. VATM: Yes. TUVOK: What is your point. NEELIX: What if we used that carriage to climb the tether? SKLAR: The tether's over 300 kilometres long. It takes twelve hours to reach the station. NEELIX: Well, we wouldn't have to go all the way to the station. We'd just have to leave the ionosphere. Once we get above all this interference we can contact Voyager to beam us aboard. VATM: I've already considered that option. The carriage was damaged on the last impact. The induction coils are off-line. NEELIX: Maybe we can replace the coils with attitude control thrusters from the shuttle. It would take a little creative mechanics, but I think we can do it. I spent two years on a tether maintenance team on Rinax. The principles are undoubtedly the same. TUVOK: Our probability of being detected by Voyager or the other rescue teams is greatest if we remain here. SKLAR: What if they don't find us in time? HANJUAN: He's right. We should try the tether. It's better than sitting here waiting to be buried in dust. NEELIX: I've helped rebuild a dozen mag-lev carriages. Give me a chance to get that one working. If I can't, we'll come back and wait for the others. TUVOK: Very well. NEELIX: You won't regret this, Lieutenant. We need to get to the base of the tether. [Mag-lev carriage] NEELIX: I think we can integrate our thrusters into the induction matrix, but we'll need to... Looks like somebody's been here recently. LILLIAS: Get away or I'll kill him! Drop your weapon! Now! This is my shelter. These are my supplies. TUVOK: We have no interest in your supplies. We are here to use the carriage to get to safety. HANJUAN: He's telling the truth. We'll take you with us. LILLIAS: The carriage is damaged. NEELIX: Yes, we know. The induction coils. But we brought equipment to replace them. VATM: I know it's been difficult. This catastrophe has taken it's toll on everyone, but you have got to believe us. We only want to get off the surface. LILLIAS: What about the oxygen converters? They've been damaged too. They can't produce enough air for six people. NEELIX: Maybe we can augment the converters. We've brought along some equipment that might do the trick. LILLIAS: I don't have enough rations for everyone. Don't expect me to share. NEELIX: If I can fix the tether, no one will need your rations. We have a starship in orbit. They'll beam us aboard once we leave the ionosphere. If I'm not mistaken, it sounds like you know a thing or two about tethers too. LILLIAS: Not really. I'm a foundry worker. NEELIX: Good. We could use someone with metallurgical knowledge. Let's get to work. Have faith, Mister Vulcan. We'll be tether-borne in no time. [Engineering] TORRES: I've completed the mineralogical scans. The rock is composed of tryoxene, olivine, wait a minute. I'm reading a concentration of triadium. NEZU AMBASSADOR: Triadium? Isn't that an alloy? TORRES: Yes. CHAKOTAY: B'Elanna, give me a hand with this. TORRES: This doesn't look like any asteroid I've ever seen, and I'll bet it's the source of our triadium. It looks like a control node for some kind of guidance system. CHAKOTAY: Ambassador, I have a feeling these asteroids aren't striking your planet by chance. [Mag-lev carriage] TUVOK: Are we ready to bring main power back on line? NEELIX: I, I think so. TUVOK: The coil by-pass is active. NEELIX: By-pass is holding. Congratulations Mister Vulcan, we've done it! TUVOK: We must still repair the oxygen regenerators and the damaged tether couplings. NEELIX: Then let's get started. I'll go check on the oxygen supply. How's it coming, Lillias? LILLIAS: I still can't get this power relay on-line. I'm not an orbital engineer, I can't do this. NEELIX: Maybe I can help. Let's see. Ah-ha! You need to recalibrate the pressure valve, like this. That should about do it. We're going to need a name. LILLIAS: A name? NEELIX: For the mag-lev carriage. Whenever we finished building a tether on Rinax, we named the carriage for good luck. Any suggestions? LILLIAS: No. NEELIX: How about - Alixia. LILLIAS: Alixia. NEELIX: My favourite sister. She was always taking me out to explore. She showed me the Caves of Touth, the equatorial dust shrouds. Once she even took me hunting for arctic spiders. Whenever I think of her, I think of adventure, and this is an adventure she would appreciate. What do you think? LILLIAS: Where is your sister now? NEELIX: She was killed when I was a young man, in a war on my home world. My entire family was lost. LILLIAS: I'm sorry. NEELIX: I still see each of them. Every night before I go to sleep, I recall their faces and share something about my day with each of them. Tonight I'm going to have quite a lot to tell them. Thank you. LILLIAS: I have a sister too. Halla. Three weeks ago after the first impact our home was destroyed and we were separated. I haven't seen her since. I don't even know if she's alive. NEELIX: When we get back to Voyager I'll ask my Captain to help you find her. TUVOK: Mister Neelix. NEELIX: Excuse me. Yes sir! TUVOK: Your interpersonal activities are delaying our progress. NEELIX: What do you mean? TUVOK: Since we arrived, you have spent as much time engaged in idle conversation as you have making repairs. NEELIX: I'm just trying to cheer everyone up a little. TUVOK: Your function at the moment is to repair this vessel, not to boost morale. This is not the holodeck nor the mess hall. This is a life-threatening situation and your attention should be focused on one thing alone - our safe return to Voyager. NEELIX: Sorry, sir. I'll finish as fast as I can. [Tether control room] LILLIAS: Once we start going up the tether will we be able to TUVOK: We've only been able to fix three of the seven power supplies. If we turn back we might not be able to reach the ionosphere. Mister Sklar, these NEELIX: Doctor Vatm! What are you doing? LILLIAS: He's opening the launch doors! He's leaving without us! NEELIX: Doctor Vatm! Please stop! The tether's base hasn't been secured. If he launches now he'll destabilise the entire cabin! SKLAR: Wait, please! Don't leave us here! TUVOK: Stand aside. [Mag-lev carriage] NEELIX: It's too late. The cabin support structure is collapsing. We've got to get out of here. TUVOK: Can we launch? NEELIX: I think so. TUVOK: Seal that door. SKLAR: I despise enclosed spaces. NEELIX: Hang on. Velocity thirty kilometres per hour. Internal atmospheric pressure seven hundred millibars. Altitude eight hundred metres and climbing. TUVOK: We're losing mag-lev cohesion. NEELIX: All right, we have to stabilise that right away, otherwise we'll go into free-fall. SKLAR: You mean we're going to drop? TUVOK: How do we prevent that? Neelix! NEELIX: Hold on, hold on, I'm thinking. Velocity. Let's try increasing the velocity. It should stabilise our ascent. See if you can increase power to the tether couplings. TUVOK: Routing back-up power to the tether couplings. NEELIX: Stand by. I'm going to try giving her a little more speed. Velocity - forty seven kilometres per hour and holding. TUVOK: Mag-lev cohesion stable. NEELIX: We're all right. Good girl, Alixia, I knew you could do it. TUVOK: Alixia? NEELIX: I named the carriage after my sister. TUVOK: For good luck, no doubt. We will need it. One of the oxygen converters has ruptured. NEELIX: We'll have to find a way of increasing output to the converter, otherwise we'll run out of air about half way up. TUVOK: What are our chances of reaching the ionosphere? NEELIX: I'd say they were pretty good. We did leave ahead of schedule, and that could cause a few glitches along the way. TUVOK: Glitches? NEELIX: I wasn't able to get the auto-ascent sequencer back on-line. That means I'll have to keep control of the ascent manually. And there is the problem of maintaining atmospheric pressure. I'm already beginning to detect a few fissures in the hull. TUVOK: We must repair them. Where is the emergency containment grid? NEELIX: Containment grid. Containment grid. Er, I'm not quite sure. TUVOK: Mister Neelix, you told me you had experience with this kind of technology. NEELIX: I did! I did! Sort of. They weren't exactly what you might call working carriages. They were more like prototypes. TUVOK: Specifically. NEELIX: All right, they were models, one tenth scale. But they were extremely detailed. TUVOK: You built models. NEELIX: Yes, but they were basically identical to real mag-lev carriages. Same principles, same mechanical components. I was planning to familiarise myself with all the systems on this carriage. I just didn't plan on leaving ahead of schedule. But don't worry, I've got everything under control. TUVOK: There is little we can do now that we are thirty kilometres above the surface. I suggest we continue to VATM: What are you doing! Let go! LILLIAS: You wanted to leave, fine, then leave. TUVOK: That is enough! He may be crucial to the survival of your colonies. LILLIAS: He would have let us die down there. TUVOK: That is no justification for murder. Doctor Vatm, why did you try to launch without us? Does it have to do with the discovery you make about the asteroids? HANJUAN: Answer him, or I'll throw you out myself! TUVOK: Compose yourself, Mister Hanjuan. Once we return to Voyager we will find out HANJUAN: Who put you in command? TUVOK: This rescue mission was authorised by the Captain of my ship and the Ambassador of your government. HANJUAN: I say we throw Vatm out the door. We could use the extra oxygen. TUVOK: If you are trying to intimidate me, I should inform you that as a Vulcan I possess physical strength many times yours. It is going to be a long and perilous journey. As such, I will need your full co-operation. Understood? HANJUAN: Yes. TUVOK: Mechanical glitches would seem to be the least of our problems. [Bridge] PARIS [OC]: We've just completed our third low altitude survey. There's no sign of Doctor Vatm or Tuvok and his rescue team. JANEWAY: We're monitoring a major dust storm heading your way. You'll need to head due north within the hour. PARIS [OC]: Acknowledged. Paris out. KIM: Captain, I'm getting more detailed sensor readings on the approaching asteroid. It's huge, over half a kilometre in diameter. It's moving faster than the others. JANEWAY: Time to impact? KIM: Approximately two hours. [Mag-lev carriage] TUVOK: Doctor, I'm going to inject you with a tri-ox compound. It will help to oxygenate your blood. I've prepared an injection of SKLAR: Yes, I know, I heard you. It won't be painful, will it? TUVOK: No. It is a simple sub-dermal transfer. SKLAR: Oh good, good. I despise needles. Any progress with the, with the converters? TUVOK: We were unable to salvage the damaged tank, but Lillias is working to increase the efficiency of the functioning one. SKLAR: And if she can't we'll all suffocate. TUVOK: It is illogical to dwell on situations beyond your control. It will only serve to heighten your anxiety which, if I may say so, is heightened enough. SKLAR: Oh, well, thank you for the reassurance. NEELIX: How is everybody? TUVOK: They are suffering the initial stages of carbon dioxide poisoning. NEELIX: And you? TUVOK: My lungs are capable of respirating in an extremely thin atmosphere. NEELIX: And if we can't fix this air supply you may be the only one left to pilot this thing. I'd better start showing you how to use the ascent thrusters. They must be kept at a minimum temperature. HANJUAN: Stop! What are you doing? VATM: Get away. Got to get out. Let me out. My colony. I'm needed. LILLIAS: So now he wants to leave. HANJUAN: Let him. VATM: No, you don't understand. There's something out there. TUVOK: What is out there? VATM: On the roof. TUVOK: He's going into shock. He's dead. NEELIX: Can you revive him? TUVOK: His cardio-pulmonary tissues have begun to deteriorate. HANJUAN: From lack of oxygen? TUVOK: No. I believe he was murdered. LILLIAS: Murdered? How? TUVOK: Poisoning. According to my tricorder readings, his water supply has been contaminated with a lydroxide corrosive. NEELIX: Lydroxide? That's the coolant used in the tether couplings. HANJUAN: How do you know it wasn't an accident? TUVOK: The coolant system is completely sealed, and there is no lydroxide anywhere else on board. SKLAR: Well, now we have a choice of death by suffocation or death by poisoning. TUVOK: I will conduct an investigation once we return to the ship. For now, we must focus on survival. HANJUAN: Again you take command. Again you decide our fate. How do we know you didn't kill him. TUVOK: I have no motive. HANJUAN: Your motive would be the same as ours. Revenge. TUVOK: I am Vulcan. I do not succumb to emotion. HANJUAN: Oh, we are expected to believe that. NEELIX: I think we should stop the carriage. TUVOK: Why? NEELIX: Something Doctor Vatm said about getting up on the roof. TUVOK: Doctor Vatm was delirious from lack of oxygen. He attempted to open the hatch of this vessel and go outside. It would have killed him and possibly all of us as well. NEELIX: Exactly. He was desperate enough to risk his own life. I think we should go up and find out what he was talking about. TUVOK: If we stop the carriage, we will risk losing mag-lev cohesion again. We'll check the roof upon returning to Voyager. NEELIX: I don't know. I've got a funny feeling about this. TUVOK: I'm not interested in your funny feeling. NEELIX: You're not listening to what I'm saying. Delirious or not, he said he needed whatever's up there. What if it's something that can help us? TUVOK: I will not debate this with you. Please pilot the craft and remain silent. NEELIX: You're going to listen to me! TUVOK: You are becoming emotionally distraught. There is little point in furthering this discussion. NEELIX: I'll tell you who's being emotional. You! You hide it beneath that Vulcan calm but truth is, you're filled with contempt and sarcasm, and I'm tired of being the target of all your hostility. TUVOK: You are mistaken. LILLIAS: No, he's not. I can see it every time you talk to Neelix. You're dismissive and condescending. TUVOK: You are projecting your own emotional bias onto my actions. I have no feelings towards Mister Neelix. NEELIX: That's right! That's exactly what I'm talking about! You have no feelings for me, but you have feelings against me. For three years you've ridiculed me and made it obvious to everyone that you have no respect for me, and I've tolerated it. You know why? You know why? Because you are smarter than I am, Tuvok, and more logical, stronger, superior in almost every way, and I admire you. But you don't have any instincts, have any gut feelings, and you don't really understand people. But non-Vulcans have feelings and they have to listen to them. I've got to listen to mine, and right now they're telling me we need to get up on that roof and find out what the Doctor was talking about. TUVOK: I disagree. NEELIX: Fine! But I'm the only one who can pilot this vessel, and we're not going anywhere until someone goes up on that roof. TUVOK: You leave me little choice. NEELIX: All right then, one of us needs to go outside. HANJUAN: I'm not going out there. SKLAR: Don't even think about me. NEELIX: I'm willing to give it a TUVOK: I will go. NEELIX: You? TUVOK: I am the logical one to make the egress. I can breathe the rarified atmosphere. SKLAR: I can't believe you're going out there. You don't even know what you're looking for. TUVOK: I'm looking for Mister Neelix's instinct. Perhaps it will be marked. NEELIX: It's strange, but I really like him. I just wish the feeling were mutual. [Mag-lev carriage roof] TUVOK: Tuvok to Neelix. [Mag-lev carriage] NEELIX: Go ahead. TUVOK [OC]: I have found a data storage device lodged in the internal circuitry. It appears to contain information about an alien starship. [Mag-lev carriage roof] TUVOK: but I will need to remove it and bring it into the cabin for further examination. [Mag-lev carriage] NEELIX: Be careful up there. If you can't remove it, don't. Sklar! What are you doing? LILLIAS: Neelix! HANJUAN: Where's Tuvok? SKLAR: Mister Tuvok returned to the surface. Get this carriage moving. LILLIAS: What are you doing! SKLAR: Now! LILLIAS: He can't. He's hurt. SKLAR: Back away. Get up. Get up! No. We're going to have to figure out how to fly this vessel. [Bridge] KIM: Captain, the asteroid is within visual range. JANEWAY: Let's see it. Ensign? KIM: There's a large crew compliment, at least two thousand. CHAKOTAY: They've remodulated their shields to fool our sensors. We're being hailed. JANEWAY: On screen. GOTH [on viewscreen]: The Etanian Order claims this territory. You will withdraw. JANEWAY: This planet belongs to the Nezu. They have five colonies here. GOTH [on viewscreen]: You are not Nezu. JANEWAY: I'm a friend of theirs. Kathryn Janeway, and I'm not going anywhere until you've lowered your weapons. GOTH [on viewscreen]: You would be willing to die for them? A loyal friend, and a foolish one. CHAKOTAY: They'll be here in under ten minutes, Captain. JANEWAY: Battlestations. [Mag-lev carriage] SKLAR: Why haven't we started? LILLIAS: If we don't get moving soon the tether couplings will give out and they'll snap. We'll lose mag-lev cohesion. SKLAR: Then get us moving. LILLIAS: I can't. I don't know how. SKLAR: There's the accelerator control. Try it. LILLIAS: It's too dangerous. We've got to secure the tether first. SKLAR: Right, you. Go outside and check the couplings. Make sure they haven't been damaged. HANJUAN: Not me. Besides I wouldn't know where to look. LILLIAS: The only person who knows how to pilot this ship is Neelix. SKLAR: It can't be that complicated! Keep trying. LILLIAS: I'm doing my best. SKLAR: Come on, come on. NEELIX: I'm glad you're all right. TUVOK: Fortunately I was able to grab hold of an induction coil and climb to safety. Thank you, Mister Neelix. NEELIX: What? TUVOK: I said thank you, for opening the door. NEELIX: Don't mention it. TUVOK: I believe we know now who killed Doctor Vatm. HANJUAN: But why did he kill him? TUVOK: The data storage device contains tactical information about an alien starship. Weapons, warp drive, shield modulations. Apparently Sklar did not want us to find it. You have an occipital concussion. I'm afraid my understanding of Talaxian physiology is limited. I cannot treat you. LILLIAS: I don't know how to do this. We're going to lose cohesion any minute know. TUVOK: Neelix, we need you. NEELIX: I don't think I can do it. TUVOK: You must. NEELIX: I can barely keep my eyes open. TUVOK: Do if for Alixia. She would be proud of you. NEELIX: I'm glad to see your interpersonal skills are improving. You're learning how to motivate people. Speed, forty five kilometres per hour. [Bridge] CHAKOTAY: The ship is within range. They're charging weapons. JANEWAY: Full power to the shields. Ready phasers. KIM: Shields down to eighty five percent. JANEWAY: Return fire. CHAKOTAY: No effect. We can't penetrate their shields. [Mag-lev carriage] NEELIX: Hang on! We're breaking through the ionosphere. Engaging induction dampers. We did it. We made it! TUVOK: Tuvok to Voyager. JANEWAY [OC]: Janeway here. Are you all right, Lieutenant? TUVOK: Yes, Captain. JANEWAY [OC]: We're a little busy right now. Prepare to beam aboard. [Bridge] KIM: Shields down to twenty three percent. Structural integrity is failing. TUVOK: Captain, this data device contains tactical information about the enemy vessel, including their shield modulation. JANEWAY: Adjust our phasers to match. Target their primary reactor. TUVOK: Ready. JANEWAY: Fire at will. TUVOK: Direct hit. Their reactor is off-line. CHAKOTAY: They're remodulating their shields. JANEWAY: Target their weapons array. Fire! TUVOK: Their weapons have been destroyed. CHAKOTAY: They're retreating, Captain. NEZU AMBASSADOR: What happened to you down there? Where's Sklar? NEELIX: Mister Sklar returned to the surface. [Mess hall] NEELIX: I've just come from the staff briefing. The people who attacked your colonies, they call themselves the Etanian Order. Apparently they have a unique way of invading other worlds. First they create what appears to be a natural disaster, in your case an asteroid bombardment. Once the population has evacuated, they arrive and stake their claim. LILLIAS: But they didn't expect Voyager to intervene, so they arrived before our colonies had been evacuated NEELIX: Exactly: LILLIAS: What about Doctor Vatm? NEELIX: From what we could tell, Doctor Vatm found out about the Etanian Order and was secretly collecting information about their starship technology. He also knew that one of your colonists was a traitor, helping the Etanians, feeding your government false information about the asteroids. But he didn't know that it was Sklar. He didn't know who to trust. LILLIAS: So that's why he tried to hide the data storage device on the roof. The damage to our world could have been much worse. Thank you. TUVOK: I have just received word from the Ambassador. Your sister Halla has been found. NEELIX: Tell her I said hello. TUVOK: Mister Neelix, I thought you should know that I have submitted my mission report to the Captain. I've given you a special commendation for your endurance and bravery. NEELIX: I'm honoured. TUVOK: Your instincts were correct. However, one day your intuition will fail and you will finally understand that logic is primary above all else. Instinct is simply another term for serendipity. NEELIX: And one day, Mister Vulcan, I'll get you to trust your gut. TUVOK: That is doubtful. NEELIX: We'll see. TUVOK: Your attempts have yet to succeed. NEELIX: You always have to get in that last word, don't you. TUVOK: I'm simply responding to your erroneous statement. NEELIX: Something tells me you just hate to lose an argument. TUVOK: Losing is irrelevant. NEELIX: See what I mean? TUVOK: No, I do not. Star Trek ® is copyright of CBS Studios INC.

       "\"Title: The Q and the Grey Stardate: 50384.2 27 November 1996 [Bridge] JANEWAY: Oh! CHAKOTAY: Incredible. JANEWAY: Absolutely thrilling. NEELIX: All I can say is wow! What about you, Mister Vulcan? Isn't that just wow! TUVOK: Your inarticulate expression of awe notwithstanding, Mister Neelix, it was a fascinating spectacle. KIM: That's the edge of the shock wave. The pressure's over ninety kilopascals, thirty percent more than we predicted. JANEWAY: Tom, back us off at full impulse. I want to stay ahead of the brunt of that wave. PARIS: Yes, ma'am. JANEWAY: Congratulations, everyone. Only two crews in the history of Starfleet have witnessed a supernova explosion. KIM: But neither one was this close. Less than ten billion kilometres. Definitely a record. JANEWAY: Who brought the champagne? NEELIX: Champagne? Captain, if I thought you wanted champagne. JANEWAY: Relax, Neelix. It's a figure of speech. KES: Thanks for inviting us to watch with you, Captain. It's really got me interested in learning more about stellar phenomenon. EMH: Just remember, Kes, anyone can stargaze on the Bridge, even a hologram with a mobile emitter, but the real action will always be in Sickbay. JANEWAY: How'd those shield modifications hold up, B'Elanna? TORRES: Less than a seven percent power drain. JANEWAY: Good job. Chakotay, what do you say we get started analysing those carbon conversion readings? CHAKOTAY: Captain, you've been on the Bridge for fourteen straight hours. Don't you think you deserve a little rest? Harry and I will get to work on the astrometric analysis, and we'll give you a full report in the morning. JANEWAY: You win. I'll see you at oh seven hundred. [Janeway's quarters] JANEWAY: Janeway to security. Intruder alert. Q: There's no need to call room service, Kathy. I've already ordered. JANEWAY: Oh, Q! Q: You did say you wanted champagne? JANEWAY: Janeway to security. Intruder alert. Q: Oh, it's no use. I've taken the proverbial phone off the hook. After all, we don't want any interruptions. JANEWAY: What are you doing here? Q: To us. JANEWAY: There is no us, Q. Q: The night is young, and the sheets are satin. JANEWAY: I want you out. But first, get rid of this bed. Q: I have no intention of getting between those Starfleet issue sheets. They give me a terrible rash. JANEWAY: Since you won't be getting in the bed, I wouldn't worry about it. Q: Oh, Kathy, don't be such a prude. Admit it. It has been a while. JANEWAY: And it's going to be a while longer. Now get out. Q: So tense. Why don't you slip into something more comfortable? JANEWAY: If you think this puerile attempt at seduction is going to work, you're even more self-deluded than I thought. Q: Now I see. You think I'm interested in some tawdry one night stand. That's because I haven't told you why I'm here yet. Out of all the females of all the species in all the galaxies, I have chosen you to be the mother of my child. JANEWAY: Oh! Q: I know that you're probably asking yourself, why would a brilliant, handsome, dashingly omnipotent being like Q want to mate with a scrawny little bipedal specimen like me? JANEWAY: Let me guess. No one else in the universe will have you. Q: Nonsense. I could have chosen a Klingon Targ, the Romulan empress, a Cyrillian microbe. JANEWAY: Really? I beat out a single-celled organism? How flattering. Q: It's an overwhelming honour, isn't it? I can't get you out of my mind. You're confident, passionate, beautiful. JANEWAY: And totally uninterested. Q: Kathy, you can't leave. My cosmic clock is ticking. Besides, you have no idea what you're missing. Foreplay with a Q can last for decades. JANEWAY: Sorry, but I'm busy for the next sixty or seventy years. Q: Oh, I see, this is one of those silly human rituals. You're playing hard to get. JANEWAY: As far as you're concerned, Q, I'm impossible to get. Q: Goody! A challenge. This is going to be fun. JANEWAY: Janeway to Bridge. CHAKOTAY [OC]: Chakotay here, Captain. [Bridge] CHAKOTAY: I thought you were going to get some sleep. JANEWAY [OC]: I've just had a visit from Q. He's gone now. [Janeway's quarters] JANEWAY: But I want to be notified immediately if he reappears anywhere on the ship or if anything odd starts to happen. [Bridge] CHAKOTAY: Acknowledged. What did he want? [Janeway's quarters] JANEWAY: Let's just say he had a personal request. [Bridge] CHAKOTAY: Captain? [Janeway's quarters] JANEWAY: I'm not sure what he's really up to, but I have a feeling he'll be back. Janeway out. [Ready room] JANEWAY: Come in. CHAKOTAY: I've got those carbon conversion readings from the supernova. JANEWAY: Thank you. Is there something else? CHAKOTAY: Have you heard anything more from Q? JANEWAY: No. I wish I could believe he's gone for good. CHAKOTAY: I was wondering just what just what you meant when you said he made a personal request. JANEWAY: He wants to mate with me. CHAKOTAY: I see. JANEWAY: Obviously, it's out of the question. And I suspect it's a smoke screen. Knowing Q, he's probably got some hidden agenda. CHAKOTAY: Maybe. JANEWAY: Chakotay. CHAKOTAY: I know I don't have any right to feel this way, but this bothers the hell out of me. Q: I do believe you're jealous. (to Janeway) Why didn't you tell me there was another man? JANEWAY: Because there isn't. I'm just not interested in you. CHAKOTAY: Any more questions? Q: I was wondering, Kathy. What could anyone possibly see in this big oaf, anyway? Is it the tattoo? Because mine's bigger. JANEWAY: Not big enough. Captain's Log, Stardate 50384.2. Q's unannounced visits continue. Since I suspect he's up to something more than pursuing me, I've instructed the crew to take every opportunity to uncover his true motives. [Holodeck - Paxau Resort] PARIS: Who says crew performance reports have to be a chore? KIM: Sure beats working on the Bridge. PARIS: Now if we could just convince the Captain to start holding morning briefings in here. KIM: That'll be the day. Q: Nice programme, Tommy. But it's all just so much holo-pleasure, isn't it? PARIS: All right, Q, we'll bite. What do you want? Q: Guys, I just don't understand your Captain. I've tried everything. Filling the Bridge with roses, writing Drabian love sonnets, serenading her in her bath. PARIS: Oh, I'll bet she loved that one. Q: But no matter what lengths I go to win her heart, she rejects me. Me! How, I ask you, is that possible? KIM: Did it ever occur to you that she just doesn't like you? Q: No. PARIS: Look, Q, we've been told about your appearances on the Enterprise. We know your little visits usually turn out to be more than meet the eye. So save your broken heart routine, and tell us what you're really after. Q: I just thought that the two of you might be able to give me some advice on how to break through Kathy's icy exterior. You know, man-to-man. PARIS: My advice would be to give up before you embarrass yourself anymore than you already have. Come on, Harry. We're not going to get a straight answer out of this guy. Q: You, bar rodent, another one of these fruity concoctions. NEELIX: Not unless you tell me why you're bothering Captain Janeway. Q: Captain Janeway? Now that's a subject I want to discuss. Tell me, what are some of her favourite things. Chocolate truffles? Stuffed animals? Erotic art? NEELIX: You can't bribe Captain Janeway. Q: Oh, no? Isn't that what you do? NEELIX: What are you talking about? Q: I understand that you acquire things for her, create little interesting diversions, prepare little tasty treats. After all, why else would she be so fond of your fur-lined face? NEELIX: Do you want to know what Captain Janeway likes about me? I'll tell you. I am respectful, loyal and most of all, sincere. And those are qualities which someone like you could never hope to possess. [Ready room] JANEWAY: This isn't going to work, Q. Q: How can you ignore that face? JANEWAY: He's adorable. But this has to stop. Q: Please accept him as a small token of my affection. JANEWAY: No. Q: Suit yourself. May we talk? Just talk. I'm afraid that I haven't been sincere. When you first asked why I wanted to have a child with you, I made jokes, bragged about my prowess, engaged in sexual innuendo. I was using all that to cover up my true feelings. JANEWAY: And I suppose you want to share your true feelings with me now. Q: I'm lonely. JANEWAY: Lonely? Q: Oh, I know it's hard to believe, but I've been single for billions of years. It was fun at first, gallivanting around the galaxy, using my omnipotence to impress females of every species. The fact of the matter is, it left me empty. I want someone to love me for myself. I guess what I'm saying is, I want a relationship. I just thought if you and I had a child, it would give me that kind of stability and security that I've been missing. JANEWAY: Sorry, Q. I'm not buying it. Q: Oh. All right. Let's see if you buy this. You're stuck out here, thousands of light years from home, and you aren't getting any younger, are you? All your hopes for home, hearth and family grow dimmer every day. Admit it, Kathryn, you're lonely too. And you wonder if you will ever have a child. JANEWAY: You're right, I would like to have a child someday. But not with you. Q: Why not? JANEWAY: I'm just not the right kind of woman for you, Q. FEMALE Q: Truer words were never spoken. Q: Q! How did you find me? FEMALE Q: Never mind that. What are you doing with that dog? I'm not talking about the puppy. Q: Can't you see I'm busy here? Stop stalking me. FEMALE Q: You should be back in the Continuum. JANEWAY: Excuse me, but who are you exactly? Q: Kathryn Janeway, may I present Q. FEMALE Q: Not just any Q. His Q. Q: We were involved for a while. FEMALE Q: About four billion years. And now you desert me to pollute the Continuum with the DNA of this narrow little being. Q: I never said it was exclusive. FEMALE Q: Stay away from him. JANEWAY: Look, Miss Q, I'll save you a lot of trouble. I have zero interest in him. Q: Oh! Now you see what you've done? And I was finally making progress. CHAKOTAY [OC]: Bridge to Janeway. You'd better come in here, Captain. JANEWAY: On my way. (to Q) I'd really appreciate it if you would take this domestic squabble off my ship. [Bridge] JANEWAY: Report. CHAKOTAY: You're not going to believe this, Captain, but another star in this cluster just went supernova. It's point oh two light years from our current position. KIM: Make that two supernovas, Commander. I just picked up another one at two one seven mark four seven. Estimated time of implosion sixty seven seconds. JANEWAY: Get us out of here, Tom. PARIS: I can't. A subspace shock wave from the star is collapsing the warp field. JANEWAY: Red alert. Tuvok, increase power to the shields. Tom, lay in a course away from that shock wave, maximum impulse. (to Q) A star going supernova is an event that occurs once every century in this galaxy. Now we're about to witness our third in less than three days, all in the same sector. Why do I suspect you have something to do with this? FEMALE Q: She maybe a member of an intellectually challenged species, but she's right. Your irresponsible behaviour is continuing to have cosmic consequences. Q: Will you stop overreacting? Always nagging. Now you see why I left her. JANEWAY: Are you causing these supernovas? Q: Well, not exactly. JANEWAY: What's that supposed to mean? PARIS: It's no use, Captain. the shock wave is too fast for us. JANEWAY: Try evasive manoeuvres. TUVOK: I'm afraid a course correction will be futile, Captain. There are now three distinct shock waves heading toward us on various trajectories. It will be impossible to avoid them all. JANEWAY: Divert auxiliary power to the shields. (to Q) You have the ability to get us out of here, so do it. CHAKOTAY: Sixteen seconds to impact. I'm not sure if the shields will hold. JANEWAY: Do something, Q. Q: Well, if you insist. FEMALE Q: That two-timing toad! TUVOK: Contact with the first shock wave within three seconds, Commander. CHAKOTAY: All hands, brace for impact. [Q Continuum - Colonial Manor House] JANEWAY: Q? Where have you taken me? Q: Well, I must admit, your gown is very becoming. JANEWAY: I don't have time for your little fantasies. Return me to Voyager. Q: This is no fantasy. You're in the Q Continuum. JANEWAY: The Continuum? Q: That's right. I'm simply allowing you to perceive it in the context your human mind can comprehend. JANEWAY: The last time you brought me here, it looked like some sort of way station on a desert road. Q: It was awfully drab, wasn't it? But this, this is a much more colourful representation for a human of American descent, don't you think? An elegant manor house, a beautiful Southern belle, a dashing Union officer determined to win her affections despite her hatred for Yankee interlopers. JANEWAY: Enough. The only thing that interests me right now is the welfare of my ship and crew. Q: Well, I'm sure your first officer, Chuckles, is it? I'm sure he's got everything under control for the moment. JANEWAY: I'd like to make sure of that myself, if you don't mind. Q: This has gone way beyond your ship. It's even gone beyond you and me. This is about the future of the Continuum itself. JANEWAY: Stop speaking in riddles, and tell me what's going on. Q: I'll do better than that. I'll show you. The Continuum is burning. The Q are in the middle of a civil war. JANEWAY: Start explaining. Q: Do you remember our friend, Quinn? JANEWAY: The Q who committed suicide aboard Voyager? Q: Do you recall what I said might happen if he were allowed to take his own life? JANEWAY: You said it would represent an interruption to the Continuum, that it could have dire consequences. Q: I'd say a civil war is pretty dire, wouldn't you? JANEWAY: His death caused this conflict? Q: It caused chaos and upheaval. Because even though he was gone, his calls for freedom and individualism continued to echo in the ears of those who believed in his teachings, myself among them. I sounded the trumpet and carried the banner. Naturally, others followed. The forces of the status quo tried to crush us once and for all, but we fought back. And now there's a cosmic struggle for supremacy, and the battle is spreading causing hazardous repercussions throughout the galaxy. JANEWAY: Oh, the supernovas. Q: You might call them galactic cross fire. It's terrible, isn't it? But it's also a wonderful opportunity. JANEWAY: I fail to see anything wonderful about a war. Q: War can be an engine of change. War can transform a society for the better. Your own Civil War brought about an end to slavery and oppression. JANEWAY: But our Civil War came at a time before mankind had learned to resolve disputes without bloodshed. Surely the Q have evolved to a point where you can find a non-violent way to resolve a conflict. Q: That's where you come in. JANEWAY: What do I have to do with any of this, Q? Q: I want you to help me transform the Continuum in the same way your Civil War transformed a nation. JANEWAY: By mating with you? Q: I know. It's brilliant, isn't it? JANEWAY: I don't see how a baby is going to end a war being fought by a race of omnipotent beings. Q: It's simple. Mating will create a new breed of Q, which will combine my omnipotence and infinite intellect with the best that humanity has to offer. JANEWAY: You believe human DNA is going to restore peace? Q: Precisely. What the Continuum needs right now is an infusion of fresh blood, a new sensibility, a new leader, a new messiah. Think of it, Kathy. Our child will be like a precious stone tossed into the cosmic lake, sending endless ripples of human conscience and compassion to wash up on every distant shore of the universe. What greater contribution could a being of your limited power ever hope to make? What is more important to humanity than peace? I'm offering you the opportunity to be the mother of peace. Well, what's it going to be? Oh! JANEWAY: Q! You're bleeding. [Bridge] CHAKOTAY: Report. TUVOK: Shield strength is at twenty percent. Hull damage on decks nine through fourteen. Minor injuries reported on all decks. PARIS: Warp drive is off-line. KIM: Commander, according to these readings, the shock waves have knocked us sixteen billion kilometres from our previous location. CHAKOTAY: (to Female Q) I want to know what's going on here. Where is Captain Janeway? FEMALE Q: Let me go before I hurl this ship and everyone on it into the Therinian Ice Age. CHAKOTAY: I don't think you can. FEMALE Q: Don't be ridiculous. CHAKOTAY: I don't know how or why, but something's affected your powers. Otherwise, you wouldn't still be here and you wouldn't have a bruise on your forehead. Now start talking before I hurl you into the brig. [Briefing room] CHAKOTAY: And it's the war in the Continuum that's causing the supernovas? TUVOK: May we presume that this conflict is also responsible for the weakening of your powers and your inability to return to the Continuum? FEMALE Q: The Vulcan talent for stating the obvious never ceases to amaze me. CHAKOTAY: How were Q and Captain Janeway able to re-enter the Continuum and you weren't? FEMALE Q: I tried to return, but I was wounded in the process. Oh, don't try to understand it, it's far beyond your limited capacity to comprehend. What's important is, I'm stuck here with you mortals while Q is probably in the process of irreparably harming the Continuum with that woman. Tossed aside for someone five billion years younger. If it weren't so laughable, I'd cry. CHAKOTAY: Look, we want our Captain back, and you obviously want to get home. Why don't we help each other? FEMALE Q: How could you possibly help me? CHAKOTAY: There's got to be some way to get back to the Continuum besides snapping your fingers. FEMALE Q: Hmm. Well, there's one possibility. But somehow, I don't think this rickety barge or your half-witted crew members are up to the challenge. TUVOK: May I remind you, madam, that this rickety barge and its half-witted crew are your only hope at the moment. [Q Continuum - Colonial Manor House] Q: Ow! That hurts. JANEWAY: Be still. I never thought a Q could be injured. Q: As I said, this is only a perception of what is happening. I can assure you, those are not mere cannonballs and lead charges being fired at us. JANEWAY: So they're some sort of Q weapons? Q: You'd be surprised what innovative munitions can be created by one immortal being who's set his mind on killing another. COLONEL Q [OC]: Hold your fire. Hold your fire! You're surrounded, Q. Surrender now. We'll be merciful. JANEWAY: Call a truce. Talk to them. Maybe you can resolve this peacefully. COLONEL Q [OC]: What's your answer, Q? Q: I’ll never surrender! You know that! COLONEL Q [OC]: Resume fire. Resume fire! Q: Get the rifle in the corner and take the other window. JANEWAY: This is your fight, Q, not mine. Q: If that's how you feel about it. But if their weapons can make me bleed, what do you think they'll do to you? JANEWAY: Q! Q, Come on. Come on. First Officer's Log, Stardate 50392.7. While we don't fully understand the astrophysics underlying her plan, the female Q has suggested several modifications which may allow Voyager to enter the Continuum. [Engineering] FEMALE Q: Well? TORRES: Well what? FEMALE Q: Are you finished yet? TORRES: What you've asked us to do requires a complete reconfiguration of the shield array. It takes a while. For us mere morals, that is. FEMALE Q: Surely there's some way you can speed up the process. TORRES: If you're in such a hurry, why don't you just snap your fingers and do it yourself? Oh, that's right. You've lost your powers and you need our help. FEMALE Q: I don't think you understand. It's imperative that I get back to the Continuum before Q mates with your Captain. TORRES: I understand perfectly. You aren't the first female who's ever had a man run out on her. FEMALE Q: I hope you're not comparing some failed romance in your pitiful existence to my eternal association with Q. TORRES: You know, I have really had it with this superiority complex of yours. FEMALE Q: It's not a complex, dear. It's a fact. TORRES: Well, here's another fact. If you don't stop pestering me, I'm never going to finish. In which case, your association with Q might not be quite as eternal as you think. FEMALE Q: you know, I've always liked Klingon females. You've got such spunk. [Q Continuum - Union army camp] Q: Where are we? JANEWAY: One of your faction's encampments. Q: How? JANEWAY: I pulled you out of the mansion and managed to hide you from the enemy patrols. Then I spotted some of your people retreating from the battle. From the look of them, I'd say you're not on the winning side. Q: You saved my life. JANEWAY: And now it's time to end all this. Q: I knew you'd come around. JANEWAY: I've been thinking about what you said, that creating a new Q could bring an era of peace. Q: Oh, my wild, sweet Kathy. I promise you won't regret it. JANEWAY: Oh, you're not going to have a child with me. You're going to mate with that charming lady friend of yours that appeared on my ship. Q: Mate with another Q? Ridiculous. JANEWAY: It sounded to me like you and she had a very long term relationship. Q: Yes, but it was never physical. I mean, the Q are way beyond sex. It's never been done. JANEWAY: Really? Then how exactly did the Q come into existence in the first place? Q: The Q didn't come into existence. The Q have always existed. Besides, I can only mate with a species capable of copulation, like you. JANEWAY: But I don't love you, Q. Q: Yes, but what does that have to do with it? JANEWAY: Everything. It's the foundation of a family. I could never have a child with someone I didn't love, much less give it up to the Continuum. Q: Dearest Kathy, I would never dream of having you give it up. I mean, who would raise it? Who would look after it? I'm really not cut out to be a wet nurse. JANEWAY: Oh, so you're not willing to do the hard work? Q: I'm an ideas man. Hard work isn't my forte. JANEWAY: I'd change specialties if I were you, because the kind of trouble you're in needs more than a quick fix. You can't just sprinkle a little human DNA into the Continuum and make everything all right. Q: Why not? JANEWAY: Those best qualities of humanity you talked about aren't a simple matter of genetics. Love, conscience, compassion. Q: Ow. JANEWAY: They're attributes that mankind has developed over centuries. Values that have passed from one generation to the next, taught by parents to their children. Creating a new kind of Q is a noble idea, but it will take more than impregnating someone and walking away. If you want your offspring to embrace your ideals, you're going to have to teach them yourself. Q: Yes, but that's exactly why I want you here, to nourish and guide the little tyke. Think of the opportunities here in the Continuum. The entire universe would be our child's playground. Together the two of you could explore dimensions you've never even imagined. 'Fess up. Isn't it even slightly tempting? JANEWAY: I'd be lying if I said no. What explorer wouldn't be intrigued by the idea of seeking out whole new dimensions. But I have other responsibilities, and I won't just abandon them. Q: Ah, yes. The crew of the intrepid starship Voyager. Perhaps you'd be interested in sending them home. JANEWAY: You've tempted me with that prospect before. But frankly, your credibility is more than a little suspect. My crew and I will get home. We're committed to that. But we're going to do it through hard work and determination. We are not looking for a quick fix. Q: Even if I wanted to mate, I wouldn't know how. It's totally unprecedented. JANEWAY: You'll figure something out. You are omnipotent, after all. Q: I need time to think about it. JANEWAY: Time's up, Q. You've got to stop this war before it destroys the Continuum. Now I'm taking this white flag, and I'm going over to the enemy camp, and I'm going to tell them you're ready to talk about terms for a cease fire. Q: Kathy, don't be a hero. JANEWAY: I'm going, Q. So if I were you, I'd start working on a way to set that precedent. First Officer's Log, supplemental. We've laid in a course for the point in space where the female Q says we can enter the Continuum and find the Captain. [Bridge] FEMALE Q: You, helm boy. Adjust course to heading two three five mark zero eight. Increase speed to maximum impulse. PARIS: Sir? KIM: Uh, Commander? CHAKOTAY: What is it, Harry? KIM: She's put us on a direct course for another star about to go supernova. FEMALE Q: You did say you wanted to get into the Continuum? CHAKOTAY: Yes, but in one piece. FEMALE Q: Try to wrap your minuscule mind around this. These supernovas are actually caused by spatial disruptions within the Continuum, the result of the war. Now, each time a star implodes, a negative density false vacuum is created which actually sucks the surrounding matter into the Continuum. CHAKOTAY: So Voyager will be pulled in too. FEMALE Q: If we time it perfectly. Otherwise, the subsequent explosion will blow you all into microfragments. TUVOK: Commander, I needn't remind you that close proximity to a supernova will crush us, whether or not we time it perfectly. FEMALE Q: You're so negative. CHAKOTAY: He does have a point. FEMALE Q: Humanoids. Q to Engineering. [Engineering] TORRES: Go ahead, Q. Female Q [OC]: Take warp drive off-line. [Bridge] FEMALE Q: Then remodulate the shields to emit a beta-tachyon pulse and prepare to emit a series of focused antiproton beams to the shield bubble. CHAKOTAY: Does this make any sense to you at all, B'Elanna? [Engineering] TORRES: I'd be lying if I said I understood it completely, but if she's thinking what I think she's thinking, we should increase power to the shields by a factor of ten! [Bridge] TORRES [OC]: That's assuming, of course, that the shield bubble doesn't ignite and burn us all to a crisp. PARIS: We'll be reaching the imploding star in thirteen seconds. I still have time to change course. CHAKOTAY: Maintain your course. B'Elanna, take warp drive offline, remodulate the shields, and get ready to emit the antiprotons. [Engineering] TORRES: Acknowledged. [Bridge] PARIS: Entering the star's corona in three seconds. CHAKOTAY: Antiprotons now, B'Elanna. [Q Continuum - Confederate Camp – night time] COLONEL Q: Ah, Captain Janeway, I presume. (to Guard) You're dismissed. I'm sorry to have kept you waiting, madam, but, please sit down. I understand you walked into our camp alone and unarmed? JANEWAY: That's right. COLONEL Q: Continuum's a dangerous place for all of us right now, not to mention a solitary human female. I admire your bravery. JANEWAY: I've come with an offer of truce from Q. COLONEL Q: I'm afraid the time for diplomacy has passed, madam. If we don't end this war quickly, the damage to subspace will be irreversible. JANEWAY: Then you agree the fighting has to stop. COLONEL Q: Most certainly. That's why we intend to bring this war to a conclusion by the most expedient means possible. JANEWAY: I'm relieved to hear you say that. May I ask how? COLONEL Q: Quite simple, really. Since Q is the ringleader of this so-called freedom faction, we shall have to execute him. JANEWAY: With all due respect, sir, there are no chapters in the history of my own people more tragic than wars which set neighbour against neighbour. Q has an idea for a non-violent way to bring this conflict to an end. I urge you to listen to what he has to say. COLONEL Q: We are already resolved, madam. I'd be greatly in your debt if you'd tell me where we can find him. JANEWAY: I won't do that. COLONEL Q: No, I didn't think you would. Guard: Excuse me, sir. COLONEL Q: Fortunately, we won't be needing your assistance. JANEWAY: I told you he's willing to negotiate. Let him go. Q: She's right. I've had a change of heart. COLONEL Q: Grovel all you want, Q. I've been waiting for this moment for an eternity. Put them both in chains. JANEWAY: Wait! What are you charging me with? COLONEL Q: Collaborating with the enemy, which in the Continuum is a crime punishable by death. [Q Continuum - Confederate camp. Outside – daytime] JANEWAY: Why won't you listen to me? I told your Commander last night we can resolve the situation peacefully. Q: If it's any consolation, there are those in the Continuum who will remember us as martyrs. JANEWAY: I'd rather skip that particular honour. Q: Still, you have to admit, there's something romantic about going to our deaths together. COLONEL Q: Do you have any last words? JANEWAY: I won't plead for my own life. From your perspective I know it seems insignificant, but what is not insignificant is the fact that the Q, as an omnipotent race, have an opportunity to be a positive force to set a higher standard for other beings in the galaxy. I implore you all, don't go through with this. Don't allow yourselves to continue using violence to resolve your differences. COLONEL Q: Q, do you have anything to add? Q: Today I sacrifice my existence for the principles of freedom and individuality that I have fought for so long. But this woman is innocent. What's more, she saved my life, and she tried to save us from each other. Kill me if you must, but let her go. COLONEL Q: That's a very touching speech, Q. But as usual, your rhetoric fails to compensate for your irresponsibility. Ready! Aim! Q: I'm sorry. JANEWAY: I know. COLONEL Q: Fire! Q: I'm hit! Oh! I'm dying! JANEWAY: Q! Q: What? JANEWAY: They're not firing at us. Q: They're not? CHAKOTAY: Harry, get to the Captain! KIM: Captain, are you all right? JANEWAY: I'm fine. Q: (to Female Q) Oh, darling, I knew you'd come for me. Aren't you going to untie me? FEMALE Q: How do I know you wouldn't run off with the next bipedal female that catches your eye? Q: Well, it just so happens I have a proposal which will reassure you of my devotion. PARIS: (to Colonel Q) Put down the gun. Q: Think of it, Q. We'd be visionaries, innovators, the parents of peace. FEMALE Q: Oh, that does have a ring to it. PARIS: Captain, what should I do with them? FEMALE Q: Q and I have a plan to end the war. Call off your troops. JANEWAY: Do as she says and I'll call my people off. FEMALE Q: They may be humanoids, but they're using our weapons. COLONEL Q: Cease fire! Cease fire! JANEWAY: Tell our people to stop shooting. PARIS: Hold your fire! KIM: Put down your weapons! Q: So, darling, have you given any thought as to how we might accomplish this historic act of procreation? FEMALE Q: I thought of nothing else since you suggested it. Q: Oh! FEMALE Q: As a matter of fact, I Q: Oh. Oh. Oh! I love it when you talk dirty. JANEWAY: Why don't I give you two some privacy? Q: Oh, Kathy, don't you like to watch? Oh! I was good, wasn't I? FEMALE Q: Very good. JANEWAY: That was it? Q: You had your chance. Don't go crying about it now. [Bridge] JANEWAY: Lieutenant Paris, what's our position? PARIS: We're back on our original course. TUVOK: All crew are present and accounted for. JANEWAY: Ensign Kim, any sign of supernovas? KIM: No, ma'am. Nothing but calm space ahead. Looks like the war is over. JANEWAY: Mister Chakotay, run a series of standard diagnostics. If everything checks out, take us to warp 6. CHAKOTAY: Aye, Captain. JANEWAY: I'll be in my ready room. [Ready room] JANEWAY: Q! Q: He's got my cheekbones, don't you think? JANEWAY: He's adorable. I'd say fatherhood agrees with you. Q: Well, I'll admit, I look at the universe in an entirely different way now. I mean, I can't go around causing temporal anomalies or subspace inversions without considering the impact it'll have on my son. JANEWAY: I'm glad to hear you intend to set a good example. Q: By the way, did I tell you how smart he is? I've already taught him how to knock small planets out of orbit. JANEWAY: And I thought you were going to teach him about love and conscience. Q: Oh, that's why we want Auntie Kathy to be the godmother now, don't we? JANEWAY: I'm honoured. Q: Yeah, well, wait until we ask you to baby-sit. Can't leave the little guy alone for a nanosecond. Well, it's time to be going. The old ball and chain really hates it when we're late. (to Baby Q) Say bye-bye. Bye-bye. Star Trek ® is copyright of CBS Studios INC.

       "'Screenplay by: John Logan SHOOTING SCRIPT INT. MEDICAL MONTAGE. DAY. Life. Glorious in its many forms. The biological pulse finding its way heroically through the cold manipu- lation of science. CREDITS as we see a beautiful montage of futuristic medical technology. Through a microscope we see cells multiplying and gene strands exponentially increasing with the vibrancy of exploding flowers. We see laser splicing and biological manipulation on the molecular level. CREDITS continue as we fade to... INT. ROMULAN SENATE CHAMBER. NIGHT. Politics... In a cavernous, shadowy chamber. Dark figures lean together and talk seriously. Their hushed, urgent tones denote the gravity of their discussion. We can’t make out the words but there is no doubt what they are talking about. The three year old HUMAN BOY who stands before them. The boy is alone and frightened, lost in the sweeping grandeur of the massive chamber. CREDITS continue as we fade to… EXT. REMAN HOMEWORLD. NIGHT. Labor... On a stark, desert planet with monolithic mountains and harsh crags shooting upward. The only light in this dark netherworld comes from the flames that accompany the hellish mining operations everywhere around us. The human boy gazes over this desolate vista and then he looks up for a moment... at the stars. Then a tall figure leads him firmly into one of the mines. The boy seems to disappear into this flaming crucible. CREDITS end as we go to... EXT. ROMULUS SUNSET. The sun is setting on the capital city of the great Romulan Star Empire. The imperial monoliths and martial towers of this bustling city glow red as the sun dips below the horizon. We slowly move down toward the most imposing building of the city. The Romulan Senate chamber. INT. ROMULAN SENATE CHAMBER. SUNSET. SENATOR TAL\\'AURA watches the proceedings with a studied look of bored indifference. She glances to the famil- iar Romulan crest that dominates one wall of the chamber: a ferocious bird-of-prey holding two planets, one in either claw. And then her eyes carefully cross the chamber to... PRAETOR HIREN -- the head of the Romulan government - presiding over the Senate from a throne-like chair. He is a capable politician in his 50s. SENATOR 1 ... but if we hesitate we’ll lose this important source of dilithium. A trade agreement is in the best interests of the Empire. SENATOR 2 Praetor, I recommend we dispatch a diplomatic mission to Celes II to open negotiations. Senator Tal\\'Aura grunts slightly at the word \"nego- tiations.\" Praetor Hiren glances to her. PRAETOR Senator Tal\\'Aura, you disagree with the motion. TAL\\'AURA No, sir. I would say \"negotiation\" is to be advised. I support all \"diplomatic\" overtures. But if you will excuse me, Praetor, I have an appointment with the Tholian ambassador. The Praetor nods. Tal’ Aura stands and leaves the chamber… but she had left something behind on her desk. A small, silver box with unusual etchings on the surface. The discussion continues as we focus on the silver box... PRAETOR Then I will call for a vote on the motion to open trade negotiations with Celes II. The Senator at the desk next to Tal\\'Aura’s glances over. The silver box is moving. The Senator watches, amazed, as the box begins to slowly fold open. Then \"legs\" appear. The box unfolds like a spider, standing on its legs. Then it is still for a moment. The Senator looks at it, puzzled. Suddenly a bright beam of green light shoots up from the spider. The Senators are stunned -- the beam shoots to the high domed ceiling of the chamber and then cascades around the interior of the room, enveloping everything in a glowing shroud of green energy. In a way, it is bizarrely beautiful. And then just as suddenly the light disappears. A moment of silence. The Praetor and Senators are baffled. PRAETOR Would someone please tell me what that was? (He turns to a guard) Alert security! A plant behind the Praetor begins to shrivel... PRAETOR (Cont\\'d) ...and have them run a... The Praetor stops suddenly -- as the flesh begins to melt from his face. Every bit of organic matter in the chamber decays. Flesh melts from bones while the Senators scream in agony. Every living thing in the chamber is dead within ten seconds. A stunning moment of silence as we take in the carnage. Then a transporter effect ripples around the spider- weapon. It disappears. And the Romulan Senate is no more. We fade to... EXT. EARTH. ALASKA. PAVILION DAY. JEAN LUC PICARD, the most beloved and respected Captain in Starfleet. His face is resolute and set. Even stern. His white dress uniform is buttoned tightly to the neck. He looks at us evenly and then utters the word that has been the watch cry for his entire life as a Starfleet officer. PICARD Duty... He lets the word resonate and then continues. PICARD (Cont\\'d) A starship captain\\'s life is filled with solemn duty. I have commanded men in battle. I have negotiated peace treaties between implacable enemies. I have represented the Federation in first contact with twenty-seven alien species. But none of this compares to my solemn duty as... Best man. Uproarious laughter. We pull back to reveal the wedding reception of WILL RIKER and DEANNA TROI. The Enterprise CREW is gathered with invited GUESTS, some from other “Star Trek” series. Riker and Deanna sit at the center of a long table. PICARD (Cont\\'d) Now, I know that on an occasion such as this: it is expected that I be gracious and fulsome with praise on the wonders of this blessed union... But have you two considered what you\\'re doing to? This is all a damned inconvenience... There is laughter from the crowd. PICARD (Cont\\'d) While you\\'re happily settling in on the Titan, I\\'ll have to train a new first officer; no doubt a stern martinet who\\'ll quote the rule book at me and never... ever ...allow me to go on away missions. (Laughter) ...Then there\\'s the matter of my new counselor. Undoubtedly some soft-spoken, willowy thing who\\'ll be probing into my darkest psyche as she nods her head and coos sympathetically. Isn\\'t that right, Deanna? Deanna nods her head and coos sympathetically. Hearty, wonderful LAUGHTER! PICARD I notice Dr. Crusher laughing along with the rest of you. As most of you know, the doctor will also soon be leaving the Enterprise, to assume command of Starfleet Medical. Again, I\\'m forced to ask, Beverly, have you considered what you\\'re doing to little ole’ me?! I\\'ll probably get some old battle-axe of a doctor who\\'ll tell me to eat my vegetables and put me on report if I don’t show up for my physical on time! BEVERLY It\\'ll serve you right. Laughter, laughter, laughter! He looks to Riker and Deanna: PICARD Really, it\\'s not too late to reconsider. No? Very well then... He smiles and raises his glass, looks at them deeply: PICARD Will Riker, you have been my trusted right arm for fourteen years; you have helped keep my course true and steady. Deanna Troi, you have been my conscience and best guide, the touchstone to the better parts of myself. You are my family. And in proper maritime tradition I wish you full sails and a clear horizon... My friends, make it so. They drink. EXT. EARTH. ALASKA. PAVILION LATER. The party guests mingle as a band plays. We are at a beautiful open-air pavilion high in the Denali Mountains. The soaring ranges of Riker\\'s native Alaska can be seen everywhere around us. DR. BEVERLY CRUSHER goes to Picard. BEVERLY (Playfully) Sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath, isn\\'t it? PICARD Please, Beverly, this is hard enough. BEVERLY If you start tearing up I promise to beam you out. Level one medical emergency. There’s no crying in Starfleet. They head off toward Riker and Deanna. Meanwhile, GEORDI LA FORGE sits with his girlfriend. LEAH I\\'ve never seen your Captain so nostalgic. Maybe he\\'s getting soft in his old age. GEORDI (Laughing) Not likely. After we installed the new Series Four replicators, he tried to order his usual tea and there was a glitch. Had us remove the whole bunch of them and put the old ones back in LEAH There! Nostalgic about old replicators. GEORDI He just likes things the way he likes them... He looks at her, smiles. GEORDI (Cont\\'d) Of course, so do I. He kisses her gently as WORF comes to them. Poor Worf is still suffering a bit from the bachelor party He plops down beside them, belches. WORF Romulan ale should be illegal. GEORDI It is, old chum. WORF Then it should be more illegal. He groans and rests his head on the table, acts like he’s going to heave. Meanwhile, Riker and Deanna are talking to Picard and Beverly. DEANNA Really, Captain, it was a lovely toast. PICARD The least I could do for you, Deanna. Besides, you know me... I’m a talking head. DEANNA And you needn\\'t worry. I\\'ll brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know. PICARD The hell you will. You know too much about me as it is ... Now you promised there are no speeches during the ceremony on Betazed. RIKER No, no speeches. No clothes either. Riker winks, mischievously. Picard looks at him. Deanna laughs. Then the band stops playing. All turn. DATA stands with the band. DATA Ladies and Gentlemen and invited Tran gendered species... In my study of Terran and Betazoid conjugal rites I have discovered it is traditional to present the \"happy couple\" with a gift. Given Commander Riker\\'s affection for archaic musical forms I have elected to present the following as my gift in honor of their conjugation. Riker shoots an amused glance to Deanna. Conjugation? Data turns to the band leader. DATA If you please, Mister Band Leader, a-one and a-two and.. The band launches into a jaunty, swing version of the Irving Berlin standard \"Blue Skies.\" DATA (Singing) \"Blue skies, smiling at me, Nothing but blue skies do I see. Blue birds, singing a song, Nothing but blue birds all day long. Never saw the sun shining so bright, Never saw things going so right...\" The crowd is appreciative. Loves the song. Except Worf, he momentarily raises his head from the table. WORF (Groaning) Ugghhh... Irving Berlin. His heads thumps down again, is about ready to BARF! Meanwhile, Riker is anxious as a kid to join the band. DEANNA (Smiles) All right, go ahead. Riker eagerly joins the band. Grabs the trombone and starts jamming with the orchestra. The song really swings. PICARD (To Deanna) May I have this dance? DEANNA With pleasure, Captain. Meanwhile, Geordi leads Leah to the dance floor as well. Beverly goes to Worf. BEVERLY Commander Worf... Do Klingons swing? WORF I am not a swinger. I am unwell. BEVERLY Don\\'t worry, I\\'m a doctor. She pulls him to the dance floor as: BEVERLY I\\'m so glad you made it back to the Enterprise before I left. WORF I was not suited for the life of a... diplomat. BEVERLY (Wry) Who\\'d have guessed? They dance. Picard and Deanna sweep past them. And we pull up and away as Data continues to sing and the crew dances. It is a joyous celebration of these people. This family. A family we love. EXT. ENTERPRISE. SPACE. The Enterprise streaks through space. INT. ENTERPRISE. CREW LOUNGE. NIGHT. Data sits in the empty Crew Lounge. As always, the android\\'s placid, neutral expression still somehow manages to convey his wonder, curiosity and idiosyncratic zest for life. Picard arrives with a very old bottle of wine. PICARD I\\'ve been saving this. Chateau Picard 2267. Batten down the hatches... He carefully uncorks the treasured bottle as: PICARD (Cont\\'d) They say a vintner\\'s history is in every glass. The soil he came from. His past as well as his hopes for the future. He pours two glasses of the wine, then raises his glass, a toast. PICARD So... To happy endings. DATA To happy endings. Picard carefully takes a tiny sip, savors the flavor, finally swallows. Enjoys it. Ahhh. Data mimics Picard. Taking a tiny sip, savoring the flavor and finally swallowing. Ahhh. DATA Sir. I noticed an interesting confluence of emotion at the wedding. I am familiar with the human concept of tears through laughter and its inverse, laughter through tears, but I could not help wondering about the human capacity for expressing both pleasure and sadness simultaneously. PICARD I understand why it would seem confusing. Certain human rituals... like weddings, birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions. These rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time. DATA And you were particularly aware of this feeling because Commander Riker will be leaving to assume command of the Titan? PICARD Will and Deanna joining the Titan. Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet Medical... DATA And this makes you \"sad\"? PICARD Well. I suppose it does a bit. I\\'m very happy for them, of course, but I\\'m going to miss them. The ship will seem... incomplete without them. DATA That is because you have a familiarity with them. You can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge. PICARD Yes. And, frankly, I envy them as well. They\\'ve made important choices; they\\'re going to have great challenges ahead of them. New worlds to conquer... He takes another sip of wine. A beat. PICARD (Cont\\'d) Seeing Will and Deanna today made me think about some of the choices I\\'ve made in my own life. Devoting myself to Starfleet ... Not marrying or having children ... All the choices that led me here. A beat. Data thinks about it. DATA The choices I made have led me here as well. This is the only home I have ever known. I cannot foresee a reason for leaving. PICARD You never know what\\'s over the horizon, Data. Before too long you\\'ll be offered a command of your own. Data looks at him; he has never really considered this. DATA If I were... I believe my memory engrams would sense the absence of your specific reactions and behavior. I would \"miss you.\" PICARD (Smiling) Now, you make a toast. DATA To new worlds... PICARD New worlds. Yes Data, brave new worlds... They drink. INT. ROMULAN SENATE. CORRIDOR. NIGHT. Flickering braziers dimly illuminate the cold, martial splendor of a Senate corridor. COMMANDER DONATRA and COMMANDER SURAN stride through the corridor. Suran is an elder Romulan officer, respected and tenacious. Donatra - a key figure in this story so pay close attention to her - is a maturer, beautiful woman... not without a dry sense of humor. SURAN The fleet commanders are nervous. They\\'ve agreed to remain at their given coordinates and await his orders. But they\\'re anxious to know what\\'s going on here. DONATRA I don’t blame them. We can\\'t keep them in the dark forever. A voice, from the shadows: VICEROY (V.O.) But in darkness, there is strength. Donatra and Suran stop. And the VICEROY steps from the shadows... He is a terrifying sight A powerful, monstrous alien creature; a tall, ashen-skinned ectomorph who bears a disturbing resemblance to the original Nosferatu. He is vampiric and lethal. He is a Reman. VICEROY Don\\'t you agree? He leads them along the corridor. INT. SENATE CHAMBER. NIGHT. We observe the Romulan crest, an imposing bird-of-prey clutching a planet in either claw, not unlike the KAOS emblem from “Get Smart,” that dominates a wall. As we hear: SHINZON (V.O.) Consider it. The great symbol of the Empire... But the bird-of- prey holds planets. Romulus, Remus. Their destinies conjoined… And then we see him... SHINZON! He is a dynamic young human in his twenties. Very handsome with pale, almost white skin and shining, golden hair. He wears a striking Reman military uniform. He stands in the center of the eerily deserted chamber. The entire floor lis a large star chart. SHINZON Yet for generations one of those planets has been Bwithout a voice. We will be silent no longer. Senator Tal\\'Aura (the female Senator who planted the weapon in the Senate chamber earlier} and two other ROMULAN COMMANDERS sit . Cadres of Shinzon’s fearsome REMAN WARRIORS stand around the chamber. They are his sinister children of the night. Even more chilling now in the flickering torch light. It’s like something out of Tim Burton. Donatra and Suran enter the chamber with Shinzon\\'s Viceroy. SHINZON Join us, Commanders. Now what\\'s the disposition of the fleet? SURAN They\\'re holding position. SHINZON And? SURAN (Bows his head) They will obey, Praetor. SHINZON It\\'s imperative we retain their allegiance or our great mission will be strangled before it can truly draw breath. DONATRA They support your intentions, sir. But they require evidence of your... sincerity. Shinzon looks at her. A quick beat. Shinzon decides to respond with benevolence. He smiles. SHINZON And they\\'ll have it. He begins to pace over the star chart. SHINZON (Cont\\'d) Tell the fleet that the days of negotiation and diplomacy are over. The Almighty Federation will fall before us. As I promised you. He stands on the area of the map that denotes the Neutral Zone between the Romulan Empire and the Federation. SHINZON The time we have dreamed of is at hand. The time... of conquest. (Sinister laugh) He carefully steps into the area of the map marked with the Federation symbol. He looks down at the star chart. SHINZON Cut off the dragon\\'s head and it cannot strike back. A beat. Donatra watches him carefully. Something in his quiet words disturbs her. SURAN How many Warbirds will you need? SHINZON None. They look at him, stunned. SURAN Praetor. You have the whole fleet at your disposal. They supported the coup, they\\'ll follow you. SHINZON The Scimitar will serve my needs. SURAN But surely... SHINZON I came this far alone ... He looks at his Reman warriors. SHINZON (Cont\\'d) We came this far alone. We require no assistance from the fleet. Now leave me to my thoughts. The Commanders and Senator Tal\\'Aura rise and leave. Shinzon looks to his Viceroy. SHINZON Are we prepared? VICEROY Yes, Praetor. A beat. SHINZON So many years for this moment. He looks up at his Viceroy, smiles. SHINZON (Cont\\'d) Bring him to me. INT. ENTERPRISE. BRIDGE. DAY. The bridge crew are at their stations. Picard is not on the bridge. WORF (Grumbles) I won\\'t do it. DEANNA It\\'s tradition,Worf. You of all people should appreciate that! (Whispers) Besides, I’ve already seen it. WORF A warrior does not appear without his clothing. It leaves him... vulnerable. RIKER I don\\'t think we\\'re going to see much combat on Betazed. DEANNA Don\\'t be too sure. Mother will be there. Worf groans. Picard emerges from his Ready Room as: WORF I won\\'t do it. PICARD Won’t do what, Mister Worf? WORF Captain. I think it is inappropriate for a Starfleet officer to appear... (Hates the word) Naked. PICARD Come now, a big, strapping fellow like you? What are you afraid of? Deanna laughs. Then a readout on Worf\\'s console attracts his attention: WORF I\\'m picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the Kolarin system. PICARD What sort of signature? Worf looks up. Glances at Data. WORF Positronic. INT. ENTERPRISE. BRIDGE. LATER. Geordi is at the Engineering station with Picard, Riker and Data. GEORDI It\\'s very faint but I\\'ve isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system. PICARD What do we know about the planet? GEORDI Uncharted. We\\'ll have to get closer for a more detailed scan. PICARD (To Data) Theories? DATA Since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself, it is logical to theorize that there is an android such as myself on Kolarus III. GEORDI How many of you did Dr. Soong make? DATA I thought only me, myself and Lore. RIKER (Looking at star chart) Diverting to the Kolarin system takes us awfully close to the Romulan Neutral Zone. PICARD (Looking at star chart) Still well on our side... Picard glances at Data, recognizes the android\\'s deep desire to explore this possible connection to others like himself. PICARD I think it\\'s worth a look. Don\\'t worry, Number One, we\\'ll get you to Betazed with time to spare. RIKER Thank you, sir... PICARD (To all, especially Worf) Where we will all honor the Betazoid traditions. No cold feet, or any other parts of our anatomy. Now, if you’ll excuse me. I’ll be in the gym. He goes. RIKER (To Helm Officer) Mister Branson, set course for the Kolarin system. Warp Five. Deanna shoots him a glance. RIKER (Cont\\'d) Warp Seven. HELM OFFICER (MISTER BRANSON) Plotted and laid in, sir. RIKER Engage. DEANNA You better believe you’re engaged! Meanwhile, Geordi and Data remain at the Engineer- ing Station, studying the displays. GEORDI What do you think, Data, a long-lost relative? Data doesn\\'t respond, but the curiosity on his face is apparent. EXT. ENTERPRISE. OVER KOLARUS III. SPACE. The Enterprise is in orbit around the uncharted planet. In the distance we can see the distorting violence of an ion storm. INT. ENTERPRISE. BRIDGE. Kolarus III is on the viewscreen, the ion storm raging beyond it. GEORDI I read six distinct positronic signatures, spread out over a few kilometers on the surface. PICARD What do we know about the population? DATA Isolated pockets of humanoids. It appears to be a pre-warp civilization at an early stage of industrial development. GEORDI Captain, I don\\'t recommend transporting, that ion storm doesn\\'t look very neighborly. -It could head this way with- out much warning . PICARD Understood. Data, Worf, you\\'re with me. Picard, Data and Worf start heading toward the turbolift. RIKER (stands, protesting) Captain, I hope I don\\'t have to remind you -- PICARD I appreciate your concern, Number One, but I\\'ve been itching to try out the Argo. RIKER Sir -- PICARD Captain\\'s prerogative, Will. There\\'s no foreseeable danger... and your wife would never forgive me if anything happened to you. He steps into the turbolift with the Data and Worf. PICARD You have the bridge, Mister Troi! The turbolift doors slide shut. The bridge crew heartily enjoys Riker\\'s momentary demotion to house husband. EXT. ENTERPRISE. OVER KOLARUS III. DAY. The shuttlebay doors slide open and the transport vehicle Argo emerges. The Argo is larger than a regular shuttle with a particularly large cargo area at the back. EXT. KOLARUS III. DAY. The Argo lands on the planet. It is primarily a desert environment with some canyons and mountains. Like Death Valley, blazing heat waves shimmer in the distance. The shuttle sits silently for a moment. We wonder at the delay, then… The rear cargo doors slide open and Picard, Data and Worf roar out on a 24th Century equivalent of a military jeep! Picard drives, Data beside him. Worf stands in the back at a mounted phaser canon. It is a muscular, exciting vehicle; a Starfleet version of the jeep from old television series \"The Rat Patrol.\" Picard screeches to a stop. Data and Worf lurch. A cloud of dust momentarily obscures them. Data quickly monitors the positronic signatures with a tricorder: DATA The closest signature is two kilometers to the west... that direction, sir. PICARD Thank you, Data. (He smiles) Let\\'s see what she can do. He roars off in a cloud of dust! Picard clearly enjoys driving. He roars over the desert terrain at breakneck speed, having a hell of a good time. His comrades don\\'t exactly appreciate his free-spirited driving panache. Worf clings on to the mounted phaser canon for dear life. Data steadies himself by grasping onto the rollbar DATA I will always be baffled by the human predilection for piloting vehicles at unsafe velocities. Picard smiles and drives a little faster. DATA (Monitoring with tricorder) Over that rise, sir... half a kilometer. They continue on. Before long they can see some- thing on the level desert floor before them. They approach and stop to discover... An android arm. The fingers patiently drumming the ground. DATA It appears to be... (He scans with his tricorder) ... an arm. WORF (Suspicious) Why is it moving? DATA Like me, it has been designed with modular power sources. PICARD Mister Worf, if you please. Worf climbs from the jeep and carefully approaches the arm. Gingerly picks it up. The arm responds to being picked up, the hand starts feeling around in the air like something from a horror movie. Worf shudders. He returns to the jeep. Quickly sets the arm down in the rear cargo area. DATA The next signature is one kilometer to the south. Picard starts the jeep in motion. Time passes as they continue on... coming across another arm... a leg... a torso... another leg... various disassembled components of a Data-like android! EXT. JEEP. KOLARUS III. CANYON. DAY. Worf stands uneasily amidst the moving body parts. There is only one component missing: the head. Picard steers the jeep into a canyon. Stops. Data scans with his tricorder, pointing it up into the gently sloping hills that form the sides of the canyon. DATA The final signature is approx- imately 300 meters up that incline. PICARD Mister Worf, accompany Data please. WORF (Uneasy) To find the head, sir? PICARD (Amused) If you don\\'t mind. Worf and Data climb up into the hills in pursuit of the final piece as Picard opens the jeep\\'s hood and checks the engine. EXT. KOLARUS III. HILLS. DAY. Worf and Data climb as Data scans and indicates the direction: DATA Ten meters... Worf pulls his phaser, ready. DATA I think it unlikely you will need your phaser to recover the cranial unit. Of course, it could bite you. Then they see it. Data\\'s head. Or the spitting image anyway. Lying inert in the dust before them. WORF It\\'s you. DATA The resemblance is... striking. Then the head\\'s eyes suddenly pop open. It looks up at them with a sort of blank, childlike wonder. HEAD Why am I looking at me? DATA You are not looking at your- self. You are looking at me. HEAD (Looking at Worf) You do not look like me. WORF No. DATA (To the head) I would like to pick you up now. May I do that? HEAD (To Worf) You have a pretty shirt. WORF Thank you. Data gently picks up the head. Looks at it. The two identical faces gaze at each other. DATA Fascinating... Then BLAM! -- a boulder near them explodes. Worf and Data spin to see... A nomadic tribe of desert ALIENS swarming toward them firing primitive plasma weapons. Data and Worf race back down the canyon, toward the jeep -- some open-field running and a bit of phaser action -- Worf firing to distract and slow the aliens, not kill them -- through all of this the head is chattering away blandly: HEAD I have two arms and ten fingers. Do you know where my arms are? I cannot see where we are going. Where are we going? (Etc... like Threepio in “Empire” when he’s strapped to Chewbacca’s back.) The action continues. Then Data finds himself almost surrounded - DATA Commander! Worf turns -- Data throws the head to Worf like a football, a perfect spiral -- the head is still chattering away -- Worf catches it-- WORF STOP TALKING! The head abruptly stops talking. Data, hands free now, quickly incapacitates the aliens around him with a dazzling demonstration of his superior strength and agility, Meanwhile, Worf tucks the head under his arm and sprints like a master running back -- evading aliens and occasionally firing his phaser-- They are closer to the jeep now --but they are in trouble -- the swarm of aliens almost overtaking them --! When a thundering BLAST sends up a shower of debris, stopping the aliens -- Picard is standing in the rear of the jeep, firing the phaser canon. Data and Worf climb into the jeep as Picard leaps into the front seat and roars off -- INT. EXT. JEEP. KOLARUS III. FOLLOWING. Worf, standing at the phaser canon, quickly hands the head to Data in the front seat: WORF If you wouldn\\'t mind. DATA Thank you. The head looks up at Picard. HEAD You have a shiny head. Picard glances at the head. DATA He is very observant. PICARD I can see that. WORF Captain! Picard turns to see that they are being pursued! The aliens are racing after them in crude desert- terrain vehicles -- PICARD (To Data) Shall we try some \"unsafe velocities?\" He floors it -- racing across the desert landscape. Worf fires the mounted phaser canon -- blasting away at the aliens, not killing them, just stopping them -- a few dramatic crashes as the alien vehicles overturn -- Meanwhile: HEAD (To Picard) You have a red shirt. DATA (To the head) This is not an appropriate time for a conversation. HEAD Why? DATA Because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle. HEAD Why? PICARD Data! DATA Sorry, sir. They continue to speed over the landscape -- bouncing and flying over natural rises in the terrain -- trying to evading their pursuers -- Picard puts the pedal to the metal and races through the alien vehicles -- weaving in and out, avoiding their fire - Worf blasts away with the phaser cannon -- an exhilarating adventure -- Finally they are within sight of the Argo -- but they see it is surrounded by more of the aliens! PICARD Mister Data. Let’s make like the wind. Data punches some buttons on a dashboard console -- and the Argo LIFTS OFF by remote control -- Data uses the console to swing the Argo around and lower the rear cargo doors -- it hovers over the surface -- Picard floors the jeep -- using a natural rise in the terrain as a ramp -- the jeep FLIES THROUGH THE AIR -- over the aliens -- and into the cargo bay -- INT. ARGO. CARGO BAY. FOLLOWING. Picard slams on the brakes -- the jeep screeches to a stop as the doors shut and the Argo shoots into the air. Picard climbs from the jeep. He nonchalantly rubs a bit of dirt from the hood and then disappears into the main cabin. Data and Worf remain in the jeep for a beat. They are stunned. WORF (Smiles) He must have Klingon blood. INT. ENTERPRISE. ENGINEERING LAB. DAY. Beverly gazes at the android head. It gazes back at her. BEVERLY I think you have nicer eyes. We pull back to reveal she is speaking to Data. Data stands with Picard, Riker and Geordi. DATA Our eyes are identical, Doctor. The android is in a framework rig that holds the various body parts in place. The parts are not yet assembled RIKER Geordi? GEORDI is at work analyzing the torso section. GEORDI Well, he seems to have the same internal mechanics as Data but not as much positronic develop- ment. The neural pathways aren\\'t nearly as sophisticated. I’d say he\\'s a prototype. Something Dr. Soong created before Data . DATA (To head) Do you have a name, sir? HEAD I am the B-9. PICARD Be-nign. Dr. Soong\\'s penchant for whimsical names seems to have no end. HEAD (To Riker) You have a fuzzy face. PICARD is trying to ignore the head. PICARD Keep me informed, Number One, and, please, put him back together. He goes. Geordi and Data begin to reassemble the B-9 piece by piece like the Tin Man as: DATA Can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you? B-9 (Blandly) I was taken from my homeworld by people called the \"PakJeds.\" They are fat. They traded me to a ship belonging to the \"Bolians.\" The \"Bolians\" are blue. They put me in a seat and asked me questions. Then they were attacked by another ship... Time passes ... And still the B-9 is yammering blandly away. He is more fully assembled. By this time Beverly is thoroughly bored . B-9 Then people called the Delviciansans picked me up. They have long teeth. They asked if I do anything to help them. I told them I could do whatever they wanted. They asked me to clean out the matrix manifolds. I told them I did not know what an Matrix manifold looks like. BEVERLY Excuse me. I have some diagnostics to run on some medical scanner things. She quickly exits. B-9 And after they showed me the \"engine manifolds.\" Then they showed me something called a \"plasma mop\" Time passes... And still the B-9 is yammering away. He is almost completely assembled by now. Riker is bored out of his mind. B-9 ...then the \"Cardassians\" put me into something called a \"garbage chute\" and I went out into space again -- WORF (V.O. on comm) Worf to Commander Riker. I have the tactical manifests ready, sir. RIKER (Quickly tapping his comm badge) Worf! Wonderful! I\\'ll be right there! ... (He stands) Duty calls, gentlemen. Carry on. He escapes. B-9 Fuzzy face is gone. DATA Yes, please continue. B-9 I was in space for a long time. Then a ship belonging to the “Talosians” picked me up. They asked me where I came from. I told them people called the “Pakleds” took me from my homeworld. They are fat… Geordi groans. Time passes. And still the B-9 is yammering away. By this time Geordi is slumped in a chair and only Data is listening. The B-9 is fully assembled. B-9 Then I opened my eyes and saw you. A beat. The B- 9 is finally done with his tale. DATA Do you know who I am? B-9 You are me. DATA No. My name is Data... I am your brother. INT. ENTERPRISE. CREW LOUNGE. NIGHT. Riker and Deanna are having dinner with Worf. DEANNA (To Worf) ... and after the ceremony on Betazed, three entire weeks for our honeymoon. RIKER We\\'re going sailing on the Opal Sea. We\\'ve booked an old-fashioned solar catamaran. Just us and the sun and the waves. WORF It seems a very... soft honey- moon. DEANNA (Amused) It\\'s meant to be relaxing. WORF A Klingon honeymoon begins with the Kholamar desert march where the couple bonds in endurance trials. If they survive the challenge they move on to the Fire Caves of Fek\\'lhr to face the demons of Gre\\'thor. RIKER Well, that sounds relaxing too. WORF It is... invigorating. They see Data enter the lounge, carefully leading the B-9. RIKER So they’ve got him up and running. WORF He\\'s a very unusual android. RIKER (Smiles) Runs in the family. They watch as Data leads the B-9 to a table. Data instructs him to sit. The B-9 sits and stares forward placidly. Data shows him how use a napkin. A note of concern passes over Deanna\\'s face as she watches Data and the B-9. There is something strangely poignant in the twin androids. One a bundle of curiosity and intelligence; the other somewhat like a slow, simple child. INT. ENTERPRISE. READY ROOM. NIGHT. Picard is at his replicator unit. PICARD Earl Grey, hot. A cup of tea appears. He takes it as the door chime sounds. PICARD Come. Deanna enters. PICARD (Cont\\'d) Counselor. DEANNA Do you have a moment, sir? PICARD Of course, sit down. He sits at his desk She sits across from him. DEANNA It\\'s about Data I\\'ve watched him with the B-9 and I\\'m troubled. Data\\'s desire for a \"family\" is very strong. I\\'m afraid he may be investing too much in the B-9. PICARD You\\'re speaking of emotional investment? DEANNA The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I\\'m afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He\\'ll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations. PICARD As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn\\'t capable of disappointment. DEANNA I don\\'t believe that, sir. We’ve shared many disappointing journeys. A quiet beat. PICARD I\\'m going to miss you. DEANNA And I you. They are interrupted by a comm signal: RIKER (V.O. on comm) Captain, you have an Alpha Priority communication from Starfleet Command. PICARD Acknowledged ... (Deanna stands) ...I\\'ll talk to Data. DEANNA Thank you, sir. She goes. Picard activates his desktop viewscreen. ADMIRAL KATHRYN JANEWAY appears on Picard\\'s monitor. Janeway is the former captain of Voyager. Her new rank fits her well, she has lost none of her dry humor and down-to-earth charm which made her a household name and beloved cult figure. PICARD Admiral Janeway. Good to see you. JANEWAY (On viewscreen} Jean Luc... How\\'d you like a trip to Romulus? All expenses paid? PICARD (Smiles) With or without the rest of the fleet? JANEWAY (On viewscreen) A diplomatic mission. We\\'ve been invited, believe it or not. Seems there\\'s been some kind of internal political shakeup. The new Praetor, someone called Shinzon, has requested a Federation envoy. PICARD New Praetor? JANEWAY (On viewscreen) There\\'s more... as always. He\\'s Reman. Picard is surprised. JANEWAY (On viewscreen) (Cont\\'d) Believe me, we don\\'t under- stand it either. You\\'re the closest ship so I want you to high tail it over there and hear what he has to say. Get the lay of the land, If the Empire becomes unstable, it could mean trouble for the entire quadrant. PICARD Understood. JANEWAY (On viewscreen} We\\'re sending you all the intelligence we have, but it\\'s not much. I don\\'t need to tell you to watch your back, Jean Luc. PICARD Not with the Romulans. JANEWAY (Smiles wryly, on viewscreen} The Son\\'a, the Borg, the Romulans, the evil Soran and that pesky Nexus. You seem to get all the easy assignments! PICARD Just lucky, Admiral. JANEWAY (On viewscreen) Let\\'s hope that luck holds. Janeway out. The transmission ends. Picard sits for a moment, intrigued. Then he goes to the bridge INT. ENTERPRISE. BRIDGE. FOLLOWING. Picard goes to his command chair: PICARD (To Helm) Lay in a new course... Take us to Romulus. Warp eight. The crew is shocked. HELM OFFICER Aye aye, sir. Course plotted and laid in... RIKER Romulus? PICARD I\\'m afraid the Opal Sea will have to wait, Number One... Engage. EXT. ENTERPRISE. SPACE. And the Enterprise jumps to high warp -- disappear- ing in a flash of dazzling light. INT. ENTERPRISE. OBSERVATION LOUNGE. DAY. Data conducts a briefing for the senior officers. Monitors currently show an image of Romulus and Remus in orbit around their sun. DATA As you can see the habitable half of Remus is always in darkness because, like Mercury, one side always faces the sun. Due to the extreme temperatures on that half of their world, the Remans live on the dark side of the planet. Various grainy and unclear new images appear to illustrate Data’s words: DATA Almost nothing is known about the Reman homeworld, although intelligence scans have proven the existence of dilithium mining and heavy weapons construction. Very obscure images of Remans appear, the crew can barely make out the monstrous figures: DATA The Remans themselves are considered an undesirable caste in the hierarchy of the Empire. RIKER But they also have the reputation of being formidable warriors. In the Dominion War, Reman forces were used as assault troops in the most violent encounters. PICARD (Grim) Cannon fodder. GEORDI Then how did a Reman get to be Praetor? I don\\'t get it. RIKER We have to assume he had Romulan collaborators. PICARD A coup d\\'etat? RIKER The Praetor\\'s power has always been the Romulan fleet. They must be behind him. Picard considers this. PICARD (To Data) What have you learned about Shinzon? The images end. There are no images of Shinzon. DATA Starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record. We can infer he is relatively young and a capablecommander. He fought seventeen major engagements in the war. All successful. Beyond that, we know nothing. PICARD Well... it seems we\\'re truly sailing into the unknown. Keep at it. Anything you can give me would be appreciated. Dismissed. The meeting breaks up. INT. ENTERPRISE. ENGINEERING LAB. DAY. The B-9 stares placidly forward. We pull back and discover that computer conduits connect the B-9\\'s head to Data\\'s head. Geordi monitors the connection. DATA At present he serves no useful function. Dr. Soong created us to become active and useful members of society. I do not believe he would have wanted the B-9 to live out his life in his present state. GEORDI I can\\'t believe the Captain went along with a memory download. DATA Captain Picard agrees that the B-9 was probably designed with the same self-actualization parameters as myself. If my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix, he should have all my abilities. GEORDI He\\'d have all your memories too. You feel comfortable with that? DATA I feel nothing, Geordi. It is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual. GEORDI An individual more like you, you mean. DATA Yes. GEORDI Maybe he\\'s not supposed to be like you. Maybe he\\'s supposed to be just like he is. Geordi completes his work. GEORDI Okay ...we\\'re done. Geordi removes the computer connections from between their heads. He carefully closes the panel in Data\\'s head as: DATA (To B-9) Do you know where you are? B-9 I am in a room with lights. He looks blankly at the console lights. DATA Can you remember our father? B-9 No. Data glances to Geordi. DATA Do you know the name of the Captain of this vessel? B-9 No. DATA Is that your final answer? GEORDI (To B-9) Do you know my name? B-9 You have a soft voice. GEORDI (Gently) Data, he\\'s assimilating a lot of programming. e member, he\\'s a prototype, a lot less sophisticated than you are. We just don\\'t know if his matrix will be able to adapt. Or if he\\'ll be able to retain any- thing. We should give him some time. Data has been studying some circuitry in the B-9\\'s neck. DATA What purpose does this serve? GEORDI (Also examining circuitry) It seems to be a redundant memory port. Maybe it\\'s for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload? DATA Dr. Soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions. GEORDI It\\'s possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing. Mind if I keep him here and run some diagnostics? DATA No, I do not mind. Data looks at the B-9 with a sort of sadness. DATA But I believe he will prove incapable of performing higher functions. GEORDI Don\\'t give up hope, Data. I know, I know, you\\'re not capable of hope. DATA (Looking at B-9) I am not. Data stands. The B-9 stands to follow. DATA No, remain with Commander La Forge. He is going to try to make you well. The B-9 sits. Data goes. Geordi watches him go. EXT. ENTERPRISE. OVER ROMULUS. SPACE. The Enterprise is in orbit around Romulus. Remus can be seen in the distance. PICARD (V.O.) Captain\\'s Log. Stardate 47844.9. The Enterprise has arrived at Romulus and is waiting at the designated coordinates. All our hails have gone unanswered. We\\'ve been waiting for seventeen hours. INT. ENTERPRISE. BRIDGE. FOLLOWING. The crew is tense. Silence. Worf, at tactical, slowly stretches his neck. Trying to release the tension. It cracks. Deanna jumps a bit. RIKER Why don\\'t they answer our hails? PICARD It\\'s an old psychological strategy, Number One. To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy. RIKER It\\'s working. PICARD (To Deanna) Counselor? DEANNA They\\'re out there, sir. Picard stands and walks to the view screen. He gazes at Romulus below and the black infinity of space beyond. They\\'re out there, Waiting. WORF Sir, I recommend we raise shields. PICARD Not yet, Mister Worf. RIKER Captain, with all due respect to diplomatic protocols -- the Federation Council\\'s not sitting out here, we are. PICARD Patience. Diplomacy is a very exacting occupation. We can wait. DATA Captain... And on the viewscreen. Shinzon\\'s magnificent Reman Warbird, the SCIMITAR, decloaks directly before the Enterprise. EXT. OVER ROMULUS. SPACE. Our first sight of this incredible ship is absolutely breathtaking. Shinzon\\'s vessel combines the clean lines of the traditional Romulan Warbird with unique weaponry and styling. It is huge, easily twice as large as the Enterprise. And it is aggressive. Awesome in its power. INT. ENTERPRISE. BRIDGE. FOLLOWING. The crew gapes at the huge ship on the viewscreen. RIKER (Slowly rising from his chair) My God... WORF (Tense) Should I raise shields? PICARD No! WORF Captain! PICARD (Firm) Tactical analysis, Mister Worf. WORF (Quickly analyzing tactical display) Fifty-two disruptor banks, twenty-seven photon torpedo bays, primary and secondary phased shields. RIKER She\\'s not out for a pleasure cruise. PICARD (Grim) She\\'s a predator. WORF We\\'re being hailed. PICARD On screen. And the image on the viewscreen transforms to: Shinzon\\'s Viceroy. He stands on the Scimitar\\'s bridge. The bridge is as unique as the rest of Shinzon\\'s ship. Instead of the usual mechanical clutter, this bridge is designed with an almost Asian simplicity. Like the rest of Reman design, it is spare and elegant. Since the Remans are more comfortable in the dark- ness, most of the light comes from the three steadily pulsing warp core relays which dramatically soar up through the floor of the bridge. The crew gazes at the bridge and the monstrous features of the viceroy. VICEROY (On viewscreen) Enterprise. We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar. PICARD Praetor Shinzon, I\\'m pleased to... VICEROY (On viewscreen) I am not Shinzon. I am his Viceroy. We are sending transport coordinates. The transmission ends abruptly. The Scimitar reappears on the viewscreen. RIKER Not very chatty. PICARD Away team. Transporter room four. Picard, Riker, Deanna, Worf and Data head toward the turbolift, energized now that the endless waiting is over. INT. SCIMITAR. OBSERVATION LOUNGE. NIGHT. The away team materializes in the most striking location on Shinzon\\'s ship: a large observation lounge. It is a huge, empty chamber. No furniture. A simple Reman mat on the floor is the only decoration. At the very top of the room there is a large, etched glass dome. It is very dark. They turn when Shinzon speaks from the shadows: SHINZON (V.O) I hope you\\'ll forgive the darkness... we\\'re not comfortable in the light. PICARD Praetor Shinzon? Shinzon moves toward them a bit, becoming slightly more illuminated, the low light shining off his golden hair. The crew cannot see him clearly in the dim light but it is evident he is human. Assuming that he was Reman, they’re surprised by this realization. Shinzon just stares at Picard through the darkness for a moment. SHINZON Captain Picard... Jean Luc Picard... I don\\'t mean to stare, it\\'s just -- well, you can\\'t imagine how long I\\'ve been waiting for this moment. I always imagined you taller, isn\\'t that odd? (To Data) You may scan me without subterfuge, Commander Data. Data scans him with a tricorder as: PICARD And you\\'re not as we imagined you. SHINZON No? WORF You are human. SHINZON Commander Worf. (Speaking in Klingon) I greet you as a valiant warrior... and as my brother. WORF (Terse, in Klingon) I\\'ll save my greetings for a better brother. Shinzon laughs, maniacally. PICARD Why have you asked for our presence here? Shinzon does not answer. He is staring deeply at Deanna, moans softly. PICARD Praetor? SHINZON (Quietly) I\\'ve never met a human woman. He slowly moves toward her, still hidden in the shadows. DEANNA I\\'m only half human. SHINZON Deanna Troi of Betazed. Empathic and telepathic abilities, ship\\'s counselor. All of this I knew... But I didn\\'t know you were so beautiful. RIKER You seem very familiar with our personnel. Shinzon moves even closer to Deanna, not taking his eyes from her. SHINZON I am, Commander Riker... (To Deanna) May I touch your hair? PICARD (Firm) Praetor, we\\'ve come to Romulus on a matter we were -- assured was of great importance. If you have anything to say to us as representatives of the Federation, I suggest you do so now. Shinzon continues to stare at Deanna. It is strangely seductive. Almost disquieting in its intensity. Deanna handles it with grace, her level gaze never leaving his. SHINZON (Softly) On the world I come from there\\'s no light. No sun. Beauty isn\\'t important. I see now there\\'s a world elsewhere. PICARD Praetor Shinzon. We’re not here to discuss your lack of a social life. SHINZON (Turning back to Picard) Yes, I\\'m sorry, Captain. (Smiling) There\\'s so much we have to talk about. PICARD I would be interested to know what we are talking about. SHINZON Unity, Captain! Tearing down the walls between us to recognize we are one people. Federation and Romulan. Human and Vulcan and Klingon and Reman. I\\'m speaking of the thing that makes us the same. We want peace. Picard and the others are stunned. SHINZON I want to end the centuries of mistrust. I want to be your ally, not your enemy. As a first step I propose we eliminate the Neutral Zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas. PICARD And the Senate supports you? SHINZON (Dry) I have dissolved the Senate. A beat. SHINZON Right now, you’re thinking this all sounds too good to be true? PICARD Yes. SHINZON And you\\'re wondering why the Scimitar is so well armed. Is this the ship of a peacemaker? Or a predator?. Picard is startled at Shinzon\\'s choice of words. SHINZON (Cont\\'d) But you\\'re also thinking the chance for peace is too promising to ignore. Above allyou\\'re trying to decide if you can trust me. PICARD Yes. SHINZON Then perhaps the time has come to add some illumination to our discussion. Computer, raise lighting four levels. Lights shoot up around the room. For the first time the crew can see Shinzon clearly. Picard actually gasps when he sees Shinzon\\'s face. The rest of the crew doesn\\'t understand his reaction. SHINZON Allow me to tell you a story that I hope will clarify my position. When I was very young I was stricken with an odd disease. I developed a hyper-sensitivity to sound. The slightest whisper caused me agony... Picard watches him carefully. Wary and strangely intense. SHINZON No one knew what to do. Finally I was taken to a doctor who had some experience with Terran illnesses and I was finally diagnosed with Shalaft\\'s syndrome. Do you know of it, Captain? PICARD You know I do. The crew is dumbfounded at Picard\\'s unusual reaction. SHINZON Then you know it\\'s a very rare syndrome. Genetic. All the male members of my family had it. Eventually I was treated. Now I can hear as well as you can, Captain. He steps toward Picard who holds his ground. SHINZON I can see as well as you can. I can feel everything you feel. He stops right before Picard. SHINZON (Cont\\'d) In fact, I feel exactly what you feel. Don\\'t I, Jean Luc? Picard stares at him with a mixture of realization and curiosity. It is as if Picard is looking into a strange, remembered mirror: Shinzon\\'s face is nearly identical to his at that age. SHINZON Do you trust me now? A beat. PICARD We need to talk, just you and I. SHINZON Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow. Just the two of us. Or just the one of us. PICARD You know I need to verify this. SHINZON I know. The crew is utterly confused. Their confusion turns to outright shock when Shinzon calmly pulls out a Reman knife and cuts his arm, drawing a little blood. He hands the knife to Data. SHINZON Tomorrow then, Captain. We have so much to discuss. Picard touches his communicator pin: PICARD Picard to Enterprise. Five to beam out. They dematerialize, the shimmering glow illuminat- ing Shinzon\\'s features. Picard\\'s eyes never leave Shinzon as the transporter effect ripples around him. INT. ENTERPRISE. SICKBAY. DAY. Beverly stands with Picard, Riker and Deanna. The Reman knife is under a protonmicroscope and other medical readouts and analysis are visible. BEVERLY There\\'s no doubt, Captain. Right down to your regressive strain of Shalaft\\'s Syndrome. He\\'s a clone. A beat as the confirmation sinks in. PICARD When was he... created? BEVERLY About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell. PICARD (Touching head) I think a skin cell’s the more likely of the two. RiKER Why? PICARD Believe me, Number One; I\\'m going to find out. Contact Starfleet Command and inform them of the situation. I need to know where the hell he came from. Deanna. He goes, Deanna following. INT. ENTERPRISE. CORRIDOR. FOLLOWING. DEANNA I would say he\\'s been trained to resist telepathy. What I could sense of his emotions were erratic, very hard to follow. PICARD Is he sincere about wanting peace? DEANNA I don\\'t know. Deanna stops him. DEANNA (Cont\\'d) Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he\\'s more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you. (She looks at him deeply) The same way you want to know him. PICARD How could I not? DEANNA Captain, don\\'t assume he\\'s anything like you are. You should resist the urge to think you know him. PICARD I not only know him, Deanna, I am him.. and he is me! He goes. INT. ENTERPRISE. RIKER AND DEANNA\\'S CABIN. NIGHT. Riker is hard at work over a series of padds. He has been working for hours. DEANNA Will, you need to rest. Riker continues to work. DEANNA (Cont\\'d) As ship\\'s counselor, I\\'m recommending you get me sleep. Riker tosses a padd on the desk. Rubs his eyes. Looks up her. RIKER Some honeymoon. She smiles and goes to him. DEANNA We have time. (She kisses him) Come to bed. She pulls him up. RIKER Imzadi, what am I going to do with you? They kiss deeply. She pulls him across the room and they fall into the bed. It is passionate, erotic. Her arms undulate around him sensually. Her fingers snake through his hair, but something is wrong. Riker\\'s hair is now blond. She starts back, her eyes growing wide. Riker is gone. She is now embracing Shinzon! SHINZON Imzadi. This is so good. DEANNA No! He caresses her face... SHINZON He can never know you as I know you... He can never touch you as I touch you. DEANNA This isn\\'t real. SHINZON Can you feel my hands... are they real? Can you feel my lips, my loins? He kisses her neck. But when he raises his head again. It is the monstrous Viceroy! Holding her. Caressing her. She is frozen in horror. But is it the Viceroy at all? Shinzon\\'s voice seems to come from the Viceroy\\'s lips: SHINZON (V.O.) I\\'m with you, Imzadi. And then it is Shinzon again, kissing her: SHINZON I\\'ll always be with you now. Now and forever. DEANNA You sick bastard! She pushes him away. RIKER Deanna?! What’s with the name calling? It is Riker. She stares at him, then clings to him desperately. EXT. ROMULAN SENATE. DAY. The Byzantine splendors of the Senate loom before us. INT. ROMULAN SENATE CHAMBER. DAY. Heavy drapes are drawn against any hint of the sun. Shinzon is in conference with the Romulan Commanders and Senator Tal\\'Aura. Commander Donatra watches him closely. Commander Suran is angry, pacing. Shinzon stands. His Viceroy lurks in a corner. SURAN Then I don\\'t understand the reason for the delay! SHINZON You don\\'t have to understand. SURAN And bringing the Enterprise here?! What possible purpose could that serve? SHINZON I have a purpose. SURAN Then perhaps you will enlight- en us? SHINZON (Snaps) Silence, Romulan! A tense beat. Shinzon regains his composure. SHINZON You must learn patience, Commander. Do you know where I learned it? In the dilithium mines of Remus. Spend eighteen hours every day under the ash of a Romulan guard’s whip and you\\'ll soon understand patience. SURAN (Carefully bows his head) Praetor. SHINZON Now go. I have some personal business. Suran and the others go. Donatra turns just as she is leaving the chamber, she sees the Viceroy going to Shinzon. And then do something odd. The Viceroy puts his hand on Shinzon\\'s chest, leans very close and talks to him quietly. This is an ancient form of Reman tele- pathic medical diagnosis. This strange sight perplexes Donatra. The doors close, blocking her view. INT. SENATE CORRIDOR. FOLLOWING. We go with Donatra and the other Romulans. Donatra speaks quietly to Suran: DONATRA How long before he has us in the dilithium mines? INT. ENTERPRISE. DATA\\'S CABIN. DAY. The B-9 sits placidly in a chair, staring forward. Then, as if a switch was thrown, he moves. He quickly rises and goes to a computer console. He efficiently starts punching in commands at an amazing velocity. INT. ROMULAN SENATE CHAMBER. NIGHT. Picard and Shinzon sit alone in a corner of the sweeping Senate chamber. The remains of dinner before them. SHINZON And when I was ready they were going to replace you with me, an exact biological duplicate. Put a Romulan agent at the heart of Starfleet to.influence your command structure. It was a bold plan. PICARD What happened? SHINZON As happens so frequently here on Romulus, a new government came to power. They decided to abandon the plan -- frankly, I think they were afraid I\\'d be discovered and it would lead to war. They weren\\'t ready for that. Picard pours a glass of Romulan ale. SHINZON Romulan ale -- I\\'m surprised. I can\\'t stand it. PICARD (Smiles) You\\'ll acquire a taste for it. A beat. They look at each other. SHINZON It\\'s not quite the face you remember. PICARD Not quite. I envy the hair- line. SHINZON A lifetime of violence will do that. My nose was broken four times. And my jaw... But so much is the same. The eyes, you recognize the eyes. PICARD Yes. The eyes have it. SHINZON Our eyes reflect our lives, don\\'t they? Yours are so confident. PICARD How did you end up on Remus? SHINZON They sent me there to die. How could a mere human survive the dilithium mines? It was... (He can\\'t find the words) I was a slave. And a monster. The only thing the Romulan guards hated more than the Remans was me. But one man took pity on me: the man who became my Viceroy. He taught me how to survive. And in that dark place, where there was nothing of myself, I found my Reman brothers. They showed me the only kindness I ever knew. A beat. He glances to the Romulan crest on the wall. SHINZON For thousands of years the Romulan Senate has met in this chamber and dictated the fate of its sister-planet... But the time has come for us to live as equals. PICARD You\\'re doing this to liberate the Remans? SHINZON No race should be a slave to another. Picard is impressed with Shinzon\\'s quiet words. SHINZON You don\\'t trust me. PICARD I have no reason to. SHINZON Of course you do. If you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people... you’d be sitting where I am now. At least I hope you would. PICARD And if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great respons- ibility in representing the Federation. I can\\'t let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions. SHINZON All I have is my personal feelings. I wasn\\'t raised with the ideals of the Federation. But I\\'m trying to understand them now. To live up to them. To live up to you. A beat. SHINZON I want to know where I come from. The Remans gave me a future. You can tell me about my past. PICARD There\\'s so much, and so much of it is dull... SHINZON Were we always explorers? PICARD No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth. It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life... SHINZON (Finishing the sentence) Looking up at the stars. PICARD Yes. SHINZON And you dreamed about what was up there. About... PICARD (Finishing the sentence) New worlds. A beat. They both reach for a carafe of water at the exact same instant. Stop. PICARD After you, Praetor. SHINZON (Smiles) Age before rank, Jean Luc. Picard smiles, pours a glass. PICARD So I\\'m not as tall as you expected? SHINZON I always hoped I would hit two meters. PICARD With a full head of hair. SHINZON (Smiles) There is that. A quiet beat. PICARD Shinzon... I\\'m trying to believe you. SHINZON I know. PICARD If there\\'s one ideal the Federation holds most dear it\\'s that all men, all races, can be united. From the first time the Vulcans came to Earth we\\'ve sought a future of peace. Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friend- ship. In time. When trust has been earned. SHINZON I\\'m honored to think I might someday speak with such eloquence. A beat. SHINZON In time, Jean Luc. PICARD In time. INT. SENATE CHAMBER. LATER. Picard is gone. Shinzon sits, thinking. His Viceroy enters. VICEROY This is a mistake. SHINZON He\\'s gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor. VICEROY (Stern) Don\\'t forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out. SHINZON (Snaps) My time. I\\'ll spend it how I choose. A tense beat. SHINZON We\\'ll return to the Scimitar. Prepare yourself for the bonding. INT. ENTERPRISE. BRIDGE. NIGHT. Picard emerges from the turbolift. Data, Worf and Geordi wait at the bridge engineering station. WORF Sir, we\\'ve had an unauthorized access into the main computer. PICARD Who was it? GEORDI It\\'s going to take some time to find out -- the data stream was rerouted through substations all over the ship. PICARD What programs were accessed? GEORDI That\\'s what I don\\'t get -- it\\'s mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations. It\\'s not even restricted material. PICARD (To Worf) Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again, we want to be ready. GEORDI (Grim) There\\'s something else. I was reviewing the sensor logs. Geordi refers to some readouts on his console. GEORDI (Cont\\'d) When the Scimitar decloaked there was a momentary spike in the tertiary EM band -- there -- You\\'re not going to believe this but it\\'s Thalaron. Picard is shocked. INT. SICKBAY. NIGHT. Picard stands, concerned, with Beverly, Geordi and Data. Monitors showing Thalaron research are visible. PICARD I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical. GEORDI Which is why our initial scans didn\\'t pick it up. But he\\'s got it, Captain. PICARD As I remember, Thalaron research was banned in the Federation because of its bioqenic properties. BEVERLY It has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level. I can\\'t overestimate the danger of Thalaron radiation, Jean Luc. A microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds. PICARD Understood. Keep on it. I need to know what he has and how to neutralize any threat. Give me options. Picard goes. Data thinks for a moment. DATA Doctor, will you excuse us for a moment? Geordi, please come with me. He and Geordi head out. Beverly returns to some medical displays showing Thalaron research, her expression deeply concerned. INT. ENTERPRISE. PICARD\\'S CABIN. NIGHT. Picard is sitting at his desk, flipping through an old photo album. He stops and stares at one of the pictures deeply troubled. We finally see the photo: Young Jean Luc Picard. A serious, unsmiling cadet at Starfleet Academy. The face before him bears a disturbing resemblance to Shinzon. The door comm chirps. PICARD Come. Beverly enters. PICARD (Cont\\'d) Beverly, come in. BEVERLY You\\'re working late. She sits, notes the picture of Young Jean Luc. PICARD Remember him? BEVERLY He was a bit proud as I recall. PICARD He was a damn fool. Selfish and ambitious. Very much in need of seasoning. BEVERLY He turned out all right. He rises, goes to a window, gazes at the Scimitar in the distance. A beat. PICARD I so wanted to believe Shinzon. But the Thalaron radiation can\\'t be explained away. Whatever he\\'s after, it\\'s not peace. BEVERLY Is he very much like you were? PICARD Yes. Data interrupts on comm: DATA (V.O. on comm) Data to Captain Picard. Geordi and I have identified the source of the unauthorized computer access. And, I believe, we have also discovered an opportunity to gain a tactical advantage. PICARD (To comm) On my way. BEVERLY (Stands) Jean Luc, Whatever you were... Right now you\\'re the man you\\'ve made yourself. He\\'s someone else. PICARD I wish I could believe that, Doctor. He goes. INT. ENTERPRISE. TURBOLIFT. MORNING. Deanna is alone on the turbolift. Then a voice makes her spin: SHINZON (V.O.) Imzadi. Shinzon stands across from her. DEANNA You\\'re not here. SHINZON (Moving to her) Very logical, Deanna... But your heart doesn\\'t constrain itself to mere logic. (He caresses her} ... Your heart longs to discover me. To know me. (He kisses her) To leave all of this behind and be with me. He pushes her against the wall, with passion and almost violence. DEANNA No. SHINZON I can feel your desire, Deanna. She forces herself to concentrate... to resist telepathically... it is a mighty effort... this Romulan is hot. And the world around her appears to be changing ...bending ... And she is momentarily in a cabin on the Scimitar. Although entirely a telepathic experience, it is as if she has actually traveled. She sees Shinzon kneeling over a small flame, she realizes she is looking through the Viceroy’s eyes. On the Scimitar, Shinzon looks up at the Viceroy/ Deanna: SHINZON I can feel your hunger to know the Reman ways... the old ways. Then the world changes again... Deanna is on the turbolift. Shinzon is pressed against her, whispering: SHINZON Don\\'t fear what you desire... She forces him away from her and -- She is alone. She sinks to her knees. Overcome with emotion. INT. SCIMITAR. VICEROY\\'S CABIN. FOLLOWING. The Viceroy, in a kind of trace, kneels before a small flame. Shinzon kneels across from him. The Viceroy raises his head. VICEROY The bond is broken. SHINZON Find her again. VICEROY No -- this is wasting time. SHINZON Do as I tell you! A Reman officer interrupts on comm: REMAN OFFICER (V.O.) Praetor, we\\'ve received the transponder signal. SHINZON (To comm) On my way. He begins to go -- but suddenly stops, a wave of illness overtaking him. The Viceroy puts his hand on Shinzon\\'s chest. A strange I moment as the Viceroy shuts his eyes and feels Shinzon\\'s chest. His mind... probing . Then the Viceroy looks up at him, grim. VICEROY It\\'s accelerating. You have no more time for games. SHINZON Have the doctors prepare. I\\'ll be on the bridge.\\' He goes. INT. SCIMITAR. BRIDGE. DAY. Shinzon stands with some REMAN ENGINEERS. SHINZON Transport. An Engineer activates a transporter and the B-9 materializes! SHINZON Welcome home. (To Engineers) Begin the download. Reman engineers go to the B-9 and open the panel in his neck, begin connecting computer conduits to the extra memory port we saw earlier. [Note: Although the audience will not know it yet, this is actually Data pretending to be the B-9.] Shinzon goes to a replicator unit and orders: SHINZON Tea, hot. A cup of tea appears. He takes it and sips as he watches his Engineers connecting the conduits to the B-9. INT. ENTERPRISE. SICKBAY. DAY. Beverly is scanning Deanna. Picard and Riker watch, concerned. BEVERLY Aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels, you\\'re completely normal. PICARD (Gently) Can you describe it, Deanna? She looks at Picard, tears in her eyes. DEANNA It was... a violation. Riker takes her hand. DEANNA (With difficulty) Shinzon\\'s Viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts. I\\'ve become a liability... I request to be relieved of my duties. PICARD Permission denied. If you can possibly endure any more of these assaults. I need you at my side. Now more than ever I... But before the words are out of his mouth... he begins to dematerialize! RIKER (To comm) Worf! Raise Shields ! But Picard is gone. EXT. OVER ROMULUS. SPACE. The Scimitar cloaks. INT. SCIMITAR. BRIG. NIGHT. Picard stands in the Reman brig. His communicator pin has been removed. Beyond the security force field a ghoulish medical apparatus is being prepared. A metal chair with laser scalpels, IV tubes and hyposprays connected to it. Reman doctors work over the mysterious chair. Shinzon enters with the B-9 following. Shinzon stands on the other side of the force field. Picard notices something immediately. Tiny veins are now visible on Shinzon\\'s face; the faintest sign of an intricate spider-web pattern of pale blue veins. SHINZON Hello, Jean Luc. PICARD Why am I here? SHINZON I was lonely... Shinzon realizes Picard is staring at the veins on his face. SHINZON (Cont\\'d) Perhaps I\\'m not aging as well as you did. He nods to a guard. The guard deactivates the force field. A Reman doctor enters and raises a hypospray toward Picard. PICARD (Resists) What are you doing? SHINZON I need a sample of your blood. What do your Borg friends say? Resistance is futile. (Maniacal laugh) The Doctor takes a quick sample of Picard\\'s blood as Picard glances to the B-9. SHINZON Yes. The bait you couldn\\'t refuse. I learned there might be an existing prototype from a Cardassian historian, then went to a great deal of trouble to find it and scatter it about on Kolarus III. I knew it would pique your curiosity and conven- iently make the Enterprise the closest ship to Romulus when I contacted Starfleet. The Reman doctor leaves the cell. The force field is reactivated. The doctor goes to the mysterious medical apparatus and analyzes Picard\\'s blood. As: PICARD All of this so you could capture me? SHINZON Don\\'t be so vain. After we found it, we made a few modifications. An extra memory port, a hidden transponder. Perhaps your eyes will be a bit less confident when you learn I\\'ve gained access to Starfleet\\'s communications protocols. I now know the location of your entire fleet ... (To B-9) You may go. B-9 Where? SHINZON Out of my sight. The B-9 obediently leaves the room as: SHINZON Maybe I\\'ll train it to do little tricks for me like your robot does. Or maybe I’ll snap its ugly head off. PICARD What\\'s this all about? SHINZON It\\'s about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who... PICARD You\\'re not Reman. SHINZON And I\\'m not quite human. So what am I? What do you see? (Peering at Picard deeply) Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured? PICARD I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is. SHINZON I see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be. PICARD I won\\'t defend my life to you. SHINZON My life is meaningless as long as you\\'re alive. What am I while you exist? A shadow? An enigma? PICARD (Stern) If your issues are with me... This has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the Federation. SHINZON Oh, but it does. We will no longer bow like slaves before anyone. Not the Romulans and not your mighty Federation. We\\'re a race bred for war. For conquest. PICARD Think about what you\\'re doing, Shinzon. Are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons? SHINZON It amazes me how little you know yourself. PICARD I\\'m incapable of such an act, and so are you. SHINZON I think the facts speak for themselves. The same noble Picard blood runs in our veins. Had you lived my life, you\\'d be doing exactly as I am. Look in the mirror, and see yourself. Shinzon looks at him deeply. SHINZON Consider that, Captain. I can think of no greater I torment for you. He turns to go. PICARD It\\'s a mirror for you as well. Shinzon turns back to him. A beat. Picard gazes at him evenly. Picard\\'s probing gaze makes Shinzon a bit uneasy. He glances to the ghoulish medical preparations. SHINZON Not for long, Captain. (Back to Picard) I\\'m afraid you won\\'t survive to witness the victory of the echo over the voice. He goes. INT. ENTERPRISE. BRIDGE. NIGHT. The ship is on Red Alert. Worf stands at tactical, muscles coiled, hungry for action. WORF No response to our hails. Geordi is hard at work at the Science station. Riker stands over him: GEORDI (Frustrated) His cloak is perfect... no tachyon emissions, no residual antiprotons. RIKER Keep at it, Geordi. Find a way in. Beverly arrives on the bridge, urgent. She carries a medical padd. BEVERLY Will, I need to talk to you. INT. SCIMITAR . BRIG. NIGHT. Picard stands in his cell, peering at the edges of the security force field, trying to spot any weakness. Then the B-9 enters the brig, he holds a Reman disruptor weapon. B-9 (To Reman guard) I am to take the prisoner to the Praetor. The Reman Guard deactivates the force field. B-9 If you resist, I will incapacitate you. He leads Picard out. INT. SCIMITAR. CORRIDORS. FOLLOWING. The B-9 leads picard through the dark corridors, holding the disruptor on him steadily. All the Remans they pass glare at Picard with undisguised loathing. The Viceroy approaches. Stops before them. VICEROY (To B-9) Where are you taking him? B-9 Praetor Shinzon wants him on the bridge. The Viceroy turns his malevolent gaze on Picard. VICEROY So, human... you\\'ve met your better self! PICARD What are you doing to Counsellor Troi? VICEROY I\\'m preparing her for Shinzon. To sooth him as she soothes you. To stand at his side as she does at yours. PICARD That will never happen. VICEROY Listen to him, android. Such a small and weak creature. Yet he roars so valiantly... He raises one taloned claw and puts a sharp fingernail on Picard\\'s chest. VICEROY (Cont\\'d) It would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest. PICARD There\\'ll be another after me. And another after that. You\\'ll find we\\'re a resilient species. VICEROY I look forward to the sport. (To the B-9, harshly) Take him. The B-9 prods Picard\\'s back roughly with the disruptor. Picard grimaces in pain. B-9 Move. The Viceroy continues away down the corridor. The B-9 leads Picard along. PICARD (Whispers) Be careful of over-playing your part, Commander! And the audience now realizes it is Data pretending to be the B-9 and rejoices. DATA Sorry, sir. I thought it added a touch of reality to the performance. They are silent as they pass a few Reman guards. Then: DATA My mission was a success, sir. I have discovered the source of the Thalaron radiation. PICARD Good work. The download? DATA He believes he has our communications protocols. But they will give him inaccurate locations for all Starfleet vessels. Data assumes the B-9\\'s posture again as they pass some Reman Warriors. DATA Move, puny human animal. They pass the Warriors. PICARD A bit less florid, Data. DATA Aye, sir... This way. He leads Picard down the corridor. INT. SCIMITAR. GENERATION CHAMBER. NIGHT. Data leads Picard into a massive chamber that soars up like a cathedral. It is the size of a small town. The whole, cavernous chamber pulses with glowing green light. DATA This entire ship is, essentially, a flying Thalaron generator. (Pointing up) All its power relays lead to that device. High above them, at the very top of the chamber, is a gigantic version of the spider-weapon we saw kill all the Romulan Senators before. It is breathtaking. PICARD A weapon. DATA It would appear so. Data rotates his left hand and then slides it forward, exposing a hidden compartment in his wrist. He removes a small, silver disc. This is a cool new piece of Federation technology called an ETU. (Emergency Transport Unit.) DATA Geordi equipped me with the prototype for the Emergency Transport Unit. I recommend you use it to return to the Enterprise. PICARD It\\'ll only work for one of us. DATA Yes, sir. PICARD We\\'ll find a way off together. Recommendations? DATA There is a shuttlebay 948 meters from our current location. Data inserts the ETU back into his wrist and they leave the chamber. INT. SCIMITAR. BRIDGE. NIGHT. The Viceroy arrives on the bridge, stops. VICEROY Where\\'s Picard? Shinzon looks at him, confused. INT. SCIMITAR. CORRIDORS. NIGHT. Security alert klaxons suddenly begin to howl and harsh Reman commands are broadcast through the corridors. DATA This way, sir! They sprint down the twisting, dark corridors -- Reman warriors suddenly appear before them! -- Data fires the disruptor as Picard launches himself into them. A fight -- Picard uses a dazzlinq series of Starfleet hand-to-hand maneuvers -- he dramatically subdues the Remans. More Reman warriors appear down the corridor. Picard grabs a disruptor. And instantly spins to fire a blazing disruptor. A battle break out in the corridor -- the energy beams and explosions illuminating the violent fire fight in strobe-like bursts. They run to another corridor and finally arrive at the shuttlebay door -- it does not open. DATA (Looking at door security panel) It seems to have an encrypted security system. Reman warriors are closing in on them. Data tosses his disruptor to Picard -- Picard catches it and instantly spins and fires -- he uses both disruptors to fire down both ends of the corridor like a Western sheriff -- keeping the Remans at bay. As Data uses both hands to punch numbers into the shuttlebay door security panel at an amazing rate-- PICARD Alacrity would be appreciated, Commander. DATA They are trying to override the access codes. Reman is really a most complex language with pictographs representing certain verb roots and... PICARD While I find that fascinating, Data, we really need that Goddamned door open! The shuttlebay door slides open. Picard lays down a blistering barrage of cover fire as he and Data duck into the shuttlebay. INT. SCIMITAR. SHUTTLEBAY. FOLLOWING. When the door closes behind them, Picard turns and fires a disruptor blast -- sealing the door mechanism. They turn to face... A fleet of very small shuttles. They are uniquely designed. Extremely compact and stream-lined. A disruptor turret on each. They move toward one as: DATA According to the ship\\'s manifest they are Scorpion- class attack fliers. They quickly climb a Scorpion. INT. SCORPION COCKPIT. SHUTTLEBAY. FOLLOWING. The cockpit of the Scorpion is cramped. Picard climbs into the pilot\\'s position. Data assumes the gunner\\'s position. They see disruptor fire trying to burn through the door to the shuttlebay -- Picard powers up the Scorpion as: Picard is trying to figure out the controls. PICARD What do you imagine this is? DATA Port thrusters, sir. Would you like me to drive? Picard shoots him a look and presses some controls. The Scorpion lifts off. Hovers a few feet over the deck. Picard elegantly swings it around toward the large shuttlebay external doors as: PICARD Can you open the shuttlebay doors? DATA (Working controls) Affirmative, sir. Negative, sir. They have instigated security overrides and erected a force field around the external portals. PICARD Well then... only one way to go. He swings the Scorpion around again so it is facing the doors they came through, the doors back into the ship. Data is dubious. DATA Do you think this is a wise course of action? PICARD We\\'re about to find out... Power up disruptors and fire on my mark. DATA Ready, Captain. PICARD Fire! And the Scorpion\\'s forward disruptors fire! The doors into the ship explode! Picard powers forward! INT. SCIMITAR CORRIDORS. FOLLOWING. And the Scorpion shoots into the corridor, past the stunned Remans. Picard banks sharply -- careens off the far side of the corridor but keeps control. The Scorpion zooms down the corridor. INT. SCORPION COCKPIT. SCIMITAR. FOLLOWING. Picard is concentrating intensely --it is like trying to control the world\\'s fastest roller coaster. INT. SCIMITAR. CORRIDORS. FOLLOWING. The Scorpion banks around a corner -- it zigs and zags through the ship at breakneck speed. INT. SCIMITAR. OBSERVATION LOUNGE. NIGHT. The doors to the observation lounge EXPLODE in. The Scorpion SHOOTS into the room and up. A disruptor blast SHATTERS the etched glass dome at the top of the room. And the Scorpion ZOOMS triumphantly into space! EXT. OVER ROMULUS. SPACE. The Scorpion seems to appear from nowhere -- slicing through the cloak of invisibility around the Scimitar. INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE. FOLLOWING. The crew sees the Scorpion appear on the viewscreen. RIKER Worf! Lock on transporters! INT. SCIMITAR. BRIDGE. FOLLOWING. Shinzon sees the Scorpion as well. SHINZON Tractor beam! Now! EXT. OVER ROMULUS. SPACE. But they are too late -- the Scorpion dematerializes- INT. ENTERPRISE. CARGO BAY. FOLLOWING. And materializes in one of the Enterprise\\'s cargo bays. Picard and Data climb out-- PICARD (To comm) Number One, emergency warp! EXT. OVER ROMULUS FOLLOWING The Enterprise dramatically powers forward and up -- rolling over in a great arc going into warp while still upside down. It disappears in a blaze of light. Fade to: INT. SCIMITAR. BRIDGE. NIGHT. Shinzon sits in his command chair as the ship streaks through space. He speaks on viewscreen with his Romulan collaborators. His face is even more finely veined now. SHINZON The Enterprise is immaterial! They won\\'t make it back to Federation space. SURAN (Angry, on viewscreen} This has gone far enough! SHINZON I thought we discussed patience, Commander. SURAN (On viewscreen) And mine is wearing thin, young man! We supported you because you promised action. And yet you delay and you waste your time playing games with Picard while-- Shinzon stands and briskly pulls down his uniform tunic~ exactly as we\\'ve seen Picard do a thousand times. SHINZON Commander Suran, the games are over. In two days the Federation will be crippled beyond repair. Does that satisfy you? SURAN (Grim, on viewscreen) For the moment. SHINZON (Brutal) And when I return... you and I shall have a little talk about showing proper respect! INT. ROMULAN SENATE. CHAMBER. FOLLOWING. The viewscreen picture of Shinzon snaps out. The Romulan sit for a silent beat. DONATRA Does anyone in this room harbor any illusions about what he means by \"showing proper respect\"? TAL\\'AURA What\\'s happening to his face? SURAN I want opinions. He is clearly out of his mind. SURAN But can he complete his mission? DONATRA Should he? They look at her. DONATRA Are you prepared to have your hands drenched in blood? He\\'ll show them no mercy. And his sins will mark us all for generations. Is that what you truly want, Romulans? A beat. DONATRA I think you should consider that question now -- or else you may have a lifetime to think about it in the dilithium mines. She turns and stalks out . INT. ENTERPRISE. READY ROOM. NIGHT. Beverly sits with Picard and Riker. BEVERLY The more I studied his DNA the more confusing it got. Finally I could only come to one conclusion... Shinzon was created with temporal RNA sequencing. He was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly, so he could replace you. PICARD But the Romulans abandoned the plan. BEVERLY As a result the temporal sequencing was never activated. Remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age. He was engineered to skip thirty years of life. But since the RNA sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down. He\\'s dying. PICARD Dying? RIKER He wasn\\'t designed to live a complete, human life span. PICARD Can anything be done for him? BEVERLY Not without a complete myelodysplastic infusion from the only donor with compatible DNA. But that would mean draining all your blood. RIKER That\\'s why he went to all that trouble to capture you. PICARD How long does he have? BEVERLY I can\\'t be sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating. Picard considers this. PICARD Then he\\'ll come for me as a donor. INT. ENTERPRISE. DATA\\'S CABIN. NIGHT. Data stands before the B-9. The B-9 has been deactivated, he stands lifeless and immobile. Data gazes deeply into his double\\'s identical features. Then he opens a panel in the B-9\\'s neck and uses a small instrument to activate the android\\'s head. The B-9\\'s eyes spring to life. He looks at Data. B-9 Brother. I cannot move. DATA No, I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines. B-9 Why? DATA Because you are dangerous. B-9 Why? DATA You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship. B-9 I do not understand. DATA I know. A beat. DATA Do you know anything about Shinzon\\'s plans against the Federation? B-9 No. DATA Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship? B-9 No. Can I move now? DATA No. I must deactivate you. B-9 For how long? DATA Indefinitely. B-9 How long is that? A beat. Data gazes at the B-9 deeply. DATA A long time, brother. Data reaches forward and deactivates his brother. The B-9\\'s eyes lose the spark of life. He stands, frozen. Data stands before him. INT. ENTERPRISE. OBSERVATION LOUNGE. NIGHT. Picard is gathered with his senior officers. A computer display illustrates Geordi\\'s words about the power of Shinzon\\'s weapon. We see a chilling graphic of the Biogenic Pulse beam spreading around a ship, then a whole planet. GEORDI It\\'s called a Cascading Bio- genic Pulse. The unique properties of Thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits. Depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship... or a planet. PICARD (Thinking) And that\\'s exactly what he\\'s going to do. RIKER Sir? PICARD His hatred of the Federation is apparent. He would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason. He is going after Earth. RIKER Oh boy. Destroy humanity and the Federation is crippled. PICARD And the Romulans invade. DEANNA How can you be certain? PICARD I know how he thinks. A beat. RIKER (To Geordi) And there\\'s no way to penetrate his cloak? GEORDI No, sir. RIKER (Frustrated) He could pass within 10 meters of every ship in Starfleet and they\\'d never know. BEVERLY But we do have one advantage. (To Picard) He needs your blood to live. He might come after you first. PICARD I\\'m counting on it... We\\'ve been ordered to head to sector 3274. Starfleet is diverting the fleet to meet us there. RIKER Strength in numbers? PICARD We can only hope so. A beat as he looks at them gravely. PICARD He can\\'t be allowed to use that weapon. All other concerns are secondary. Do you understand me? Riker knows exactly what Picard is saying: the Enterprise is expendable. RIKER Yes, sir. Picard stands. Presses a comm button. PICARD All hands. Battle stations. INT. ENTERPRISE. VARIOUS ANGLES. We see a montage of the Enterprise preparing for battle. Crew members assume battle stations. Weapons locker ring open and Security Officers hand out sidearms and phaser rifles. Geordi and his Engineers establish emergency force field around the warp core. Riker and Worf brief officers on tactical plans. Data works at the bridge Science Station, analyzing data on Shinzon\\'s ship. Picard walks through the corridors, he stops to talk with apprehensive young ensign. As we hear: PICARD (V.O.) Captain\\'s Personal Log. Supplemental. We\\'re heading toward Federation space at maximum warp. The crew has responded with the dedication I\\'ve come to expect of them. And like a thousand other commanders on a thousand other battlefields throughout history, I wait for the dawn. The montage ends as: INT. ENTERPRISE. SICKBAY. NIGHT. Picard enters sickbay. Dr. Crusher and her medical staff are hard at work. They position anti-grav gurneys and ready medical supplies. Security officers are handing out phasers. Picard watches the grim preparations. Beverly goes to him, bolstering her phaser. PICARD (Quietly) To seek out new life and new civilizations. Zephyr. Cochran’s own words. When Charles Darwin set out on the H.M.S. Beagle, on his journey into the unknown... he sailed without a single musket. BEVERLY (Gently) That was another time. PICARD How far we\\'ve come. Let me know if you need anything. He starts to go. BEVERLY Jean Luc ... (He stops) He is not you. A beat. PICARD What makes us who we are, Doctor? Can you tell me that? She watches him go. INT. SCIMITAR. BRIDGE. NIGHT. Shinzon sits in his command chair, lined with veins now. His Viceroy again has his hand pressed to Shinzon\\'s chest. SHINZON How long? VICEROY A matter of hours now. Shinzon shoves him away. Stands. VICEROY If you don\\'t begin the pro- cedure soon you\\'ll never make it back to Romulus. You shouldn\\'t have delayed. You should have killed Picard the moment... Shinzon slams his command chair in fury. The Viceroy watches him carefully. A beat. Shinzon regains his composure. He sits again in his command chair. SHINZON How long until we reach the Rift? VICEROY (Checking a console) Seven minutes. Shinzon leans back, satisfied. And looks at the viewscreen. The image on the viewscreen is shocking. The Enterprise only a few hundred yards away. EXT. ENTERPRISE. SPACE. The Enterprise zooms through space. Completely unaware of the predator directly above it. INT. ENTERPRISE. ASTROMETRICS. NIGHT. Data is at work in Astrometry. Cartographic project- ions of star systems ebb and flow on a large screen before him. Picard enters. PICARD Show me our current position. The images before them quickly change to show another sector and a blip representing the Enterprise. PICARD How long until we reach the fleet? DATA At our current velocity we will arrive at sector 3274 in approximately 40 minutes. The images before them change to show sector 3274. We see blips denoting Starfleet ships moving into position. Picard gazes at the projection of stars before them for a moment. PICARD (Quietly) \"For now we see but through a glass darkly...\" He said he\\'s a mirror. DATA Of you? PICARD Yes. DATA I do not agree. Although you share the same genetic structure, the events of your life have created unique individual. PICARD But so much is the same. On a biological level he is... and I will not accept the idea that there is nothing I can do. I have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him. DATA He would deny a \"human\" connection is possible. He considers himself entirely Reman. PICARD He may have already rejected my humanity, but you also have a twin DATA No, sir, it is not possible. The B-9 is physically identical to me, although his neural pathways are not as advanced. But even if they were, he would not be me. PICARD How can you be sure? DATA I aspire, sir. To be better than I am. The B-9 does not. Nor does Shinzon. A beat. PICARD We\\'ll never know what Shinzon might have been. Had he stood where I did as a child? And looked up at the stars. Picard\\'s words linger in the air for a moment. Then the projections before them sputter with static for a moment. Flickering. DATA (Working controls) We are passing through the Bassen Rift. The projections will return when we have cleared it. PICARD It\\'s interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography? DATA Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications. PICARD (Urgent, to comm) Commander Riker, evasive maneuvers! Too late. The ship QUAKES -- a photon torpedo blast -- the Enterprise is under attack! EXT. THE RIFT. SPACE. Disruptor beams appear from nowhere -- streaking through space -- slamming into the Enterprise’s warp drive. The Enterprise recoils, dangerously dropping out of warp in a furious lurch. The Bassen Rift is a strange area of electromag- netic distortion. Energy patterns crackle through space. INT. SCIMITAR. BRIDGE. FOLLOWING. Shinzon sits in his command chair. The viewscreen shows the Enterprise before him. SHINZON Target weapons systems and shields. I don\\'t want the Enterprise destroyed. On the viewscreen, we see disruptor blasts streak- ing from the Scimitar -- slicing into the Enterprise. SHINZON Can you learn to see in the dark, Captain? INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE. FOLLOWING. Picard and Data emerge from the turbolift as the ship ROcKS. PICARD Report. RIKER He\\'s firing through his cloak. We can\\'t get a lock. GEORDI (At engineering station) He disabled our warp drive with his first shot. We\\'ve only got impulse. WORF Long range communication is impossible as long as we\\'re in the rift-- The ship SHUDDERS again. PICARD Worf, prepare a full phaser spread, zero elevation. All banks on my mark. Scan for shield impacts and stand by photon torpedoes. WORF Aye, sir The ship ROCKS again. PICARD Fire! EXT. THE RIFT. SPACE. The Enterprise fires her phasers simultaneously -- the energy beams shoot into space. And the Scimitar\\'s shape is momentarily illuminated as one of its shields is hit. Photon torpedoes immediately shoot from the Enterprise -- but pass harmlessly through the area where the Scimitar\\'s shields were momentarily illuminated. INT. SCIMITAR. BRIDGE. FOLLOWING. SHINZON You\\'re too slow, old man. (Entering commands in his chair console) Attack pattern Shinzon Theta. EXT. THE RIFT. SPACE. The invisible Warbird makes a dramatic run straight over the Enterprise -- firing steadily down as it sweeps past it; is a brutal, close range assault. INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE. FOLLOWING. The bridge SHAKES violently under the ruthless attack. DATA We are losing dorsal shields. PICARD Full axis rotation to port! Fire all ventral phasers! EXT. THE RIFT. SPACE. The Enterprise instantly complies -- Rolling completely over to the left, firing phasers up as Shinzon\\'s invisible ship streaks above it. A few lucky phaser shots from the bottom of the Enterprise -- now shooting upward -- manage to momentarily illuminate the bottom shields of the Scimitar as it sweeps past above. INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE. FOLLOWING. WORF Minimal damage to the Scimitar. RIKER (To Helm) Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon. Geordi, get those shields online. PICARD (To comm) Counselor Troi, report to the bridge. RIKER Unless we can disable his cloak we\\'re just going to be firing in the dark. PICARD Agreed. WORF Sir, we\\'re being hailed. PICARD On screen. Shinzon appears on the viewscreen. He is on the bridge of the Scimitar. SHINZON (On viewscreen) Captain Picard, will you join me in your Ready Room? INT. ENTERPRISE. READY ROOM. Picard stands in his Ready Room. A flickering light shimmers across the room. And a perfect holographic representation of Shinzon appears before him. SHINZON You can\\'t trace my holographic emitters, Captainn. So don\\'t bother. And you can\\'t contact Starfleet. We\\'re quite alone. PICARD We are. SHINZON It\\'s just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me. PICARD Why are you here? SHINZON To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship. PICARD And what of the Enterprise? SHINZON I have little interest in your quaint vessel, Captain. If the Enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years, it will not be harmed. PICARD You know that\\'s not possible. SHINZON I know... you\\'ll all gladly die to save your home world. PICARD (Intense) Look at me, Shinzon! Do you feel the blood pumping inside you? Your hands, your eyes, your nature, are the same as mine. Buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you\\'ve forgotten. It\\'s the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it\\'s the very thing that truly defines us. To be human is to try to make yourself better than you are. Picard looks at him deeply, relentlessly refusing to give up. PICARD I know you as well as I know myself, Shinzon. There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be. SHINZON (Quietly) Long ago. PICARD Not so long. SHINZON Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I\\'m what you see now. PICARD I see more than what you are. Picard steps toward him. PICARD I see what you could be. Shinzon slowly backs away as Picard continues to move toward him relentlessly. PICARD The man who is Jean Luc Picard and Shinzon of Remus won\\'t exterminate the population of an entire planet! He is better than that! SHINZON (Desperate) He is what his life has made him! Shinzon is in turmoil. Picard senses this. He proceeds quietly: PICARD And what will he do with that life? Shinzon looks at him, questioning. PICARD If I were to beam to your ship... let you complete your medical procedure, give you a full life... what would you do with the time? Shinzon doesn\\'t respond. PICARD You once asked me about your past. Your history. When I was your age, I burned with ambition. I was very proud and my pride often hurt people. I made every wrong choice a young man can ...But one thing saved me ...I had a father who believed in me. Who took the time to teach me a better way. You have the same father. SHINZON Yes. PICARD So if I gave you my life, what would you do with it? Would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? Or could you change? Could you try to remember a mother\\'s touch you never felt? A father\\'s words you never heard? Could you do that? SHINZON (Quietly) I don\\'t know. PICARD But you want to. Shinzon doesn\\'t respond. But Picard knows he has made a connection. For this brief moment reconciliation is possible. He proceeds quietly: PICARD Let me tell you about our father. Shinzon looks at him with an aching sadness. What might have been. SHINZON That\\'s your life... not mine. PICARD Please. SHINZON It’s too late. PICARD You can still make a choice! Make the right one now! SHINZON I have no choices! I can\\'t fight what I am! Shinzon backs away, unable to fight his nature: SHINZON I\\'ll show you my true nature. Your nature. And as Earth dies -- remember that I\\'m forever Shinzon of Remus! And my voice will echo through time long after yours has faded to a dim memory. Shinzon ends the transmission and his holographic image flickers and fades away. Picard stands alone, drained. INT. SCIMITAR. BRIDGE. FOLLOWING. Shinzon strides quickly to his command chair, barking to his Viceroy: SHINZON Disable their weapons! But before the Viceroy can move the Scimitar suddenly ROCKS -- attacked from somewhere! Shinzon is stunned. SHINZON Report! REMAN OFFICER Two ships decloaking, sir! Romulan! INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE. FOLLOWING. Picard strides to his command chair as two Romulan Warbirds appear on the viewscreen. Deanna is now on the bridge. RIKER Believe it or not, I think the cavalry has arrived. WORF We\\'re being hailed. PICARD On screen. On the viewscreen: Commander Donatra shimmers into view. DONATRA (On viewscreen) Captain Picard, Commander Donatra of the Warbird Valdore. Might we be of assistance? PICARD Your timing is impeccable, Commander. DONATRA (On viewscreen) The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you\\'ve become involved. PICARD When this is over, I owe you a drink. On the viewscreen, the Valdore ROCKS from a disruptor blast. DONATRA (On viewscreen) Romulan ale, Captain. Let\\'s get to work. Valdore out. The transmission ends. PICARD (To Worf) You heard the lady. Get to work. Move your ass! [The Scimitar must remain decloaked to fire weapons and are visible throughout the battle.] Although Shinzon\\'s ship is still cloaked, the steady barrage of triangulated phaser and disruptor fire from the Enterprise and the two Romulan vessels illuminate its shields with impacts. INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE. FOLLOWING. PICARD (To Worf) Coordinate our attack with the Valdore\\'s tactical officer. Triangulate fire on any shield impacts. WORF Aye, sir. The Enterprise ROCKS from a photon torpedo impact. DATA Aft shields are down to forty percent. RIKER (To Helm) Keep our bow to the Scimitar. Auxiliary power to forward shields. INT. SCIMITAR BRIDGE. FOLLOWING. Shinzon sits quite calmly in his command chair. SHINZON Target the flanking Warbird. All forward disruptor banks on my mark. EXT. THE RIFT. SPACE. It is a chaos of starships as the Enterprise and the two Warbirds fire steadily -- illuminating the Scimitar\\'s shields. The ships sweep around one another, maneuvering for position, firing constantly. The battlefield seems impossibly crowded as the four vessels evade and attack; as phaser and disruptor beams criss-cross space. Then the Scimitar unleashes a devastating volley. All her forward disruptor banks fire at once. They literally cut one of the Romulan ships in half - a huge EXPLOSION -- debris SHOOTS across space and SLAMS VIOLENTLY off the Enterprise\\'s forward shields. INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE. FOLLOWING. The ship ROCKS dangerously! DATA Forward shields are down to ten percent. RIKER (To Helm) Bring us about! EXT. THE RIFT. SPACE. The Enterprise quickly turns about -- firing her aft phasers. As the Valdore sweeps toward Shinzon\\'s ship, firing. INT. SCIMITAR. BRIDGE. FOLLOWING. SHINZON Let her pursue -- drop cloak on the aft port quadrant and prepare for full emergency stop. VICEROY (Startled) What?! SHINZON You heard me. INT. VALDORE. BRIDGE. FOLLOWING. Donatra leans forward in her command chair, looking at viewscreen. She sees part of the Scimitar\\'s rear cloak inning to fall away-- DONATRA She\\'s losing her cloak! Stand by all forward disruptor banks! INT. SCIMITAR. BRIDGE. FOLLOWING. VICEROY She\\'s almost on us. SHINZON Not yet. On the viewscreen we see the Valdore in pursuit, gaining. The Reman crew iss getting nervous. VICEROY Praetor... SHINZON FULL STOP AND FIRE ! EXT. THE RIFT. SPACE. The Scimitar LURCHES to a stop! Too fast for the Valdore to respond in time -- it flies over the Scimitar. And the Scimitar fires! A devastating volley of photon torpedoes rip into the underbelly and aft of the Valdore as it streaks past. The Valdore careens out of control and then slows to a stop. It floats dead in space. INT. SCIMITAR. BRIDGE. FOLLOWING. SHINZON Restore the aft cloak and bring us about. He leans back in his command chair, ready for the final battle. INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE. FOLLOWING. A bloody Commander Donatra is talking to Picard on viewscreen. Her bridge is in ruins. DONATRA (On viewscreen) I\\'m afraid that drink will have to wait, Captain. PICARD Do you have life support? DONATRA (On viewscreen} For the moment. But we\\'re dead in the water. PICARD Understood. Then the ship ROCKS- EXT. THE RIFT. SPACE. The invisible Scimitar sweeps past for a particularly brutal assault -- disruptor blasts streak along the Enterprise\\'s hull -- a huge, ripping series of explosions tear away several decks of the Enterprise. INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE. FOLLOWING. DATA We have lost structural integrity on decks twelve through seventeen, sections four through ten. GEORDI Emergency force fields are holding. RIKER Evacuate those decks and reroute field power to forward shields. Deanna goes to Picard: DEANNA Captain -- I might have a way to find them. PICARD Counselor? DEANNA The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me. PICARD Make it so. She quickly goes to Worf at tactical. INT. SCIMITAR. BRIDGE. NIGHT. Shinzon is entering tactical commands in his chair console. SHINZON Prepare a lateral run -- all starboard disruptors. Then the viceroy suddenly stiffens, alarm in his eyes. VICEROY No! INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE. FOLLOWING. Deanna concentrates furiously, eyes closed. She stands with Worf, her hand slowly moving his over the photon torpedo targeting display. It is a wrenching experience as she probes with her thoughts. DEANNA He\\'s resisting me. She is in pain. INT. SCIMITAR. BRIDGE. FOLLOWING. The Viceroy concentrates, trying to block her probing thoughts. SHINZON What is it?!! Focus on your job!! VICEROY She is here. INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE. FOLLOWING. Deanna continues to move Worf\\'s hand over the target- ing display. She is sweating, panting for breath, concentrating fiercely. INT. SCIMITAR. BRIDGE. FOLLOWING. The Viceroy resists her -- their psyches lock in battle. Deanna appears in the Viceroy\\'s mind, she glares at him. DEANNA Remember me? INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE. FOLLOWING . Her eyes snap open. DEANNA NOW! Worf instantly fires a full volley of photon torpedoes. EXT. THE RIFT. SPACE. A full spread of photon torpedoes shoot through space. And connect! A series of devastating impacts -- and the Scimitar\\'s cloak fails! INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE. FOLLOWING. Picard stands quickly. PICARD Savage them! EXT. THE RIFT. SPACE. And the Enterprise attacks. It fires all weapons simultaneously -- phasers and photon torpedoes slam into the Scimitar! Shinzon\\'s ship responds quickly --maneuvering for position and returning fire! INT. SCIMITAR RIDGE. FOLLOWING. The bridge has been damaged, sparks sputter through the darkness and debris litters the deck. Shinzon eyes reflect a growing sense of desperation. SHINZON (Spinning to his Viceroy) Prepare a boarding party -- BRING ME PICARD! The viceroy strides out as Shinzon spins to another officer. SHINZON Get the cloak back! And target shield coordinates beta three. All disruptors. Fire! On the viewscreen, we see disruptor beams focusing on a tiny part of the Enterprise\\'s lower shieJds, slamming into them. INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE. NIGHT. DATA Captain, we have lost ventral shielding on deck twenty nine. PICARD Divert power and compensate. An alarm klaxon suddenly rings through the bridge. WORF Intruder alert! RIKER Let\\'s go. Riker and Worf quickly head toward the turbolift as: WORF (To comm) Security detail to deck twenty nine. Data immediately assumes Worf\\'s position at tactical. INT. ENTERPRISE. LOWER DECKS. NIGHT. Riker and Worf stride with a SECURITY DETAIL through the cramped lower decks. A sudden disruptor blast stops them cold! The Viceroy and his invasion force of a dozen Reman Warriors are down the corridor! The Enterprise crew returns fire. It is a blazing phaser battle, Worf leading his men with Klingon courage. They steadily advance in the face of the blistering disruptor fire. They are getting the upper hand when Riker sees the Viceroy escape into a Jeffriess tube. RIKER Worf. Worf instantly dives into the corridor -- landing hard and sliding forward on his stomach all the while firing a steady burst from his phaser rifle. Riker uses the cover to dive after the Viceroy, following him into the dark Jefferies tube, intent on destroying the man who has been tormenting his wife. INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE. FOLLOWING. The Scimitar sweeps into view on the viewscreen -- filling the screen -- and launches a ferocious volley of photon torpedoes. A huge EXPLOSION as the viewscreen and some of the forward bridge are BLOWN APART -- the Helm Officer is SUCKED INTO SPACE before a flickering emergency force field springs into position. Deanna races to assume the helm. Picard can now see his enemy directly through the gaping bole in the ship\\'s hull -- he sees the Scimitar banking for another attack run as part of the ship disappears. GEORDI He\\'s getting his cloak back. We have exhausted our compliment of photon torpedoes. Phaser banks are down to four percent. PICARD What if we target all phasers in a concentrated attack? DATA The Scimitar\\'s shields are still at seventy percent. It would make no difference, sir. Picard thinks. DEANNA They\\'re stopping... Through the hole in the hull, Picard sees the Scimitar slowly turning. Slowly advancing. They see another part of the Scimitar disappear, the cloak returning. GEORDI What\\'s he doing? PICARD (Grim) He wants to look me in the eye. INT. ENTERPRISE. JEFFERIES TUBE. FOLLOWING. Below decks, Riker stalks the Viceroy through a labyrinthine series of access tunnels. It is like a scene from ALIEN. The flickering half-light and red emergency strobes of the crippled ship make this an ominous sequence. The Viceroy is in his element, used to the perpetual night of the Reman Homeworld, he can see in the dark. Riker moves through the darkness, hunting for the Viceroy .He stops, phaser ready. He peers into the dark tunnel ahead of him. Sees nothing. We tilt up and see... The Viceroy clinging to the ceiling directly above Riker! Hidden in the darkness. The Viceroy attacks! -- diving down on Riker -- his lethal Reman knife slashing through the darkness. INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE. FOLLOWING. Picard stands... watching the Scimitar maneuver into position. Large parts of it are now cloaked. It stops. Only a few hundred yards from the Enterprise, its great brow almost filling the gaping hole at the front of the bridge. Picard thinks, his mind racing. Then it comes to him in a flash: PICARD He thinks he knows exactly what I\\'m going to do. GEORDI Sir? PICARD We’ve got him! He sits in his command chair and begins quickly enter- ing command instructions in his chair console. INT. SCIMITAR. BRIDGE. FOLLOWING. Shinzon, supremely confident, leans back in his command chair. SHINZON Open a channel. INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE. FOLLOWING. Picard is still entering commands in his chair console. DATA We are being hailed. PICARD Deanna, stand by. (To Data) Open a channel. SHINZON (V.O.) I hope you\\'re still alive, Jean Luc. PICARD I am. SHINZON (V.O.) Don\\'t you think it\\'s time to surrender? I\\'ll have my cloak back in a matter of minutes and your poor ship is shot to pieces. Why should the rest of your crew have to die? Picard continues to enter command codes -- transmits them to Deanna at helm -- she receives the commands, nods. All of this as Picard buys some time: PICARD I never told you about my first Academy evaluation, did I? I received very high marks for my studies. But I was found lacking in certain other areas. Personality traits, you might say. In particular I was thought to be extremely... Picard glares up at the prow of the Scimitar. PICARD (Cont\\'d) Over-confident. Picard indicates for Data to end the communication. Then: PICARD (Quickly) Geordi, put 211 power to the engines. Take it from life support if you have to -- everything you can give me. GEORDI Aye, sir. PICARD Deanna, on my mark. GEORDI Ready, sir! Picard leans forward in his chair: PICARD (On comm) All hands, brace for impact! (To Deanna) ENGAGE. EXT. THE RIFT. SPACE. The Enterprise powers forward in a final thrust--! INT. SCIMITAR. BRIDGE. FOLLOWING. Shinzon sees it coming -- utterly shocked -- bolts up. SHINZON HARD TO PORT ! Too late. EXT. THE RIFT. SPACE. A massive COLLISION as the Enterprise SLAMS into the Scimitar -- as it SMASHES and GRINDS into Shinzon\\'s ship -- The Scimitar REELS. INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE. FOLLOWING. Everyone goes FLYING! EXT. THE RIFT. SPACE. The two great ships are now locked together, slowly rotating in space. The forward part of the Enterprise\\'s saucer is enmeshed in Shinzon\\'s ship; two scorpions with their claws locked. INT. SCIMITAR BRIDGE. FOLLOWING. Shinzon stands in the ruins of his bridge. Many of his bridge crew are now dead. SHINZON Divert all power to engines. Full reverse! EXT. THE RIFT. SPACE. Every part of the Enterprise ROCKS -- a great lurch as the Scimitar begins to tear itselc free -- backing away --a deafening shriek of metal --both ships are being torn to pieces .in the process -- but it is working --the Scimitar is ripping free, wrenching itself loose. INT. ENTERPRISE. JEFFERIES TUBES. FOLLOWING. The Jefferies tube SHUDDERS as the Scimitar continues to tear itself free -- Riker and the Viceroy careen through the tube. The Viceroy recovers quickly and coils for a final attack. Riker sees that an access plate has been loosened in the collision -- he desperately rips it away -- knowing the relays behind will provide him with the advantage he needs. Bright liqht strobes from the relays and the Viceroy is momentarily blinded -- Riker uses this opportunity to attack! He dives forward --slamming into the Viceroy --they both tumble into a long, vertical access tunnel -- they fall! Riker shoots out a hand and grabs a ladder -- the Viceroy, grabs onto Riker, his talons digging into his uniform -- a long drop below them! Riker forces the Viceroy\\'s head back -- away from him -- a brutal struggle. Riker glares at him . RIKER Don\\'t worry -- Hell is dark. Riker uses every ounce of strength he has left -- pushes the Viceroy off him. The Viceroy falls down the long tunnel -- to his death. INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE. FOLLOWING. The whole Enterprise bridge QUAKES as the Scimitar continues to pull itself free. Picard stands, steadying himself on his command chair. PICARD Data, I need you. Data joins Picard as: PICARD Computer. Auto-destruct sequence Omega. Zero time delay. Recognize voice pattern Jean Luc Picard. Authorization Alpha Alpha Three Zero Five-- COMPUTER (V. O.) Auto-destruct is off-line. Then the ship gives a final LURCH. The Scimitar is free. An eerie moment of silence after the explosive tear- ing and grinding. Picard watches through the gaping hole in the hull as the Scimitar backs away. Another section of the Scimitar disappears. Shinzon almost has his cloak back. INT. SCIMITAR BRIDGE. FOLLOWING. Shinzon stares at the Enterprise. A wave of sickness overcomes him for a moment, he doubles over. We actually see more veins appearing on his face. Time is running out. SHINZON Target disruptors. Destroy them. REMAN OFFICER Disruptors are off-line, sir. A beat. Shinzon looks up. SHINZON Deploy the weapon. Kill everything on that ship. Then set a course for Earth. REMAN OFFICER What about Picard? SHINZON Our greater goal is more important, brother. REMAN OFFICER But, Praetor, you won\\'t survive without him... Shinzon gazes at the Enterprise on the viewscreen. SHINZON Some ideals are worth dying for, aren\\'t they, Jean Luc? EXT. RIFT. SPACE. The entire Scimitar slowly begins to unfold. Like a gigantic version of the small spider-weapon we saw kill the Romulan Senators before, legs appear and hoist up a savage weapon. The Cascading Pulse. INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE. FOLLOWING. Picard and the others watch the monstrous Cascading Pulse weapon slowly deploying. PICARD How long until he can fire? GEORDI The targeting sequence should take about four minutes. DEANNA But how can he? He\\'ll kill you. PICARD This isn\\'t about me anymore. Picard\\'s face is set, resolute. He knows what he must do. Picard grabs a phaser rifle from a weapons locker as: PICARD Prepare for a site-to-site transport. GEORDI (Concerned) Sir, we won’t be able to bring you back. It’s a one way trip. Captain, I don\\'t know if the transporter... PICARD That\\'s an order, Commander. DATA Sir, allow me to go. You are needed here. PICARD Negative. DATA Sir. Deanna takes Data\\'s arm. Looks at him. She knows this is something Picard must do himself. DEANNA Let him go. Picard powers up the phaser rifle as: PICARD (To Data) You have the bridge, Commander. Use all available power to move away from the Scimitar. (To Geordi) Now, Mister La Forge. GEORDI Aye, sir. Geordi nervously works some controls on his console and Picard dematerializes. Then the transporter panel explodes in a shower of sparks GEORDI That\\'s it. Transporters are down. Data thinks for a moment. Then: DATA Counsellor Troi, please assume command. Geordi, if you will come with me. He heads toward the turbolift, Geordi following. INT. SCIMITAR. CORRIDOR. NIGHT. Several Remen warriors in the corridor turn an fire. Riker returns fire, a series of lightning fast pulses from his phaser rifle. INT. ENTERPRISE FORWARD CORRIDOR. NIGHT. Data and Geordi stand in a long corridor. The far end of the corridor opens to space. An emergency force field is in place at the end of the corridor. Geordi operates a tricorder and another force field flickers on around him. Data looks toward the end of the corridor, readying himself. DATA What is our approximate distance? GEORDI (Scanning with tricorder) 400 meters. DATA Thank you. Data backs up a little more. He looks at Geordi again. Deeply. DATA Thank you, Geordi. Deactivate the field. Geordi operates his tricorder and the force field at the end of the corridor snaps off -- The void of space fills the corridor and Data takes a running start -- he races down the long corridor and leaps -- EXT. THE RIFT. SPACE. Into space. He floats toward the Scimitar, his momentum carrying him. Carrying him too far! He is going to miss the Scimitar --almost past it now! He thrusts out a hand -- And just misses a piece of dangling wreckage! Data is floating helplessly through space. Doomed. Then he SLAMS into an invisible piece of the partially cloaked on the ship! He grabs onto the invisible part of the ship and pulls himself up to the hull. He rips open an access panel with his superior strength and climbs inside. INT. SCIMITAR. BRIDGE. NIGHT. Shinzon stands, his eyes glued to the Enterprise on the viewscreen. We see a monitor showing that the Cascading Pulse weapon is locked on the Enterprise. Most of the light on the shattered bridge now comes from the three steadily pulsing warp core relays which soar up through the floor. COMPUTER (V.O) Forty-seven. Forty six... Suddenly -- a MASSIVE BLAST as the doors to the bridge explode in. Shinzon spins to see: Picard framed in the doorway, phaser rifle ready. Picard instantly fires for the Cascading Pulse control -- but Shinzon dives to cover it -- the phaser blast hits Shinzon in the chest --he recoils, slamming to the deck, stunned. The few remaining Remans on the bridge spin to Picard, firing disruptors -- Picard dives for cover and battles them with his phaser rifle -- He succeeds in stunning the Remans but a final disruptor blast knocks Picard to the deck -- the phaser rifle spins away - COMPUTER (V.O.) Twenty nine... Twenty eight... Shinzon pulls himself up and races to snatch up a disruptor from a fallen comrade. As Picard leaps up, grabbing a piece of wreckage, a long metal rod -- Picard thrusts it forward like a spear. Impaling Shinzon. A stunned moment,of silence as Shinzon gazes at Picard, almost with a look of disbelief. Blood spews from his mouth as he lets out a tormented cry. And then, amazingly, Shinzon forces himself forward -- pushing. Picard backs against a wall -- Shinzon slowly walks toward Picard, forcing himself down the length of the spear -- the spear point explodes through Shinzon\\'s back --the weight of Shinzon\\'s body is pinning Picard against the wall -- time is running out -- COMPUTER (V.O.) Eighteen... Seventeen... Shinzon forces himself down the spear: SHINZON I\\'m glad we\\'re together now -- our destiny is complete. He finally thrusts himself down the whole spear and clasps his dying hands firmly around Picard\\'s throat. COMPUTER (V.O.) Ten... Nine... Data sprints to the bridge. He instantly tears open his wrist and pulls out the small, silver disc we saw earlier -- the Emergency Transport Unit --he slaps it on Picard\\'s shoulder. A final look between them- COMPUTER (V.O.) Seven... Six... Data activates the ETU -- Picard dematerializes. Data looks at the space where Picard was and says simply: DATA Goodbye. Then he spins and pulls out his phaser. And fires point-blank into the Scimitar\\'s warp core relays -- the bridge explodes -- Data is incinerated. EXT. THE RIFT. SPACE. The Scimitar BLASTS APART in a massive flash. INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE. FOLLOWING. Picard re-materializes. He sees the brilliant flash from the explosion through the gaping ~ hole in the front of the bridge. Deanna sits at helm, her face a mask of pain. Geordi stands on the upper rear deck, head down. A long beat as Picard just stands on his ruined bridge, the thousand-yard stare of a combat veteran in his eyes. Riker emerges from the turbolift. Goes to Picard. RIKER Sir? Picard doesn\\'t answer, he just stares forward. Deanna goes to Riker. DEANNA Data. Riker looks toward the glowing debris field in the distance. He puts an arm around Deanna. Silence. GEORDI Sir, we\\'re being hailed. PICARD On screen. He remembers there is no longer a viewscreen. PICARD (Cont\\'d) Open a channel. DONATRA (V.O.) This is Commander Donatra of the Valdore. We\\'re dispatching shuttles with medical personnel and supplies. PICARD Thank you, Commander. The transmission ends. PICARD (Flat) Geordi... prepare the shuttle- bay for arrivals. They don\\'t know our procedures so just... open the doors. GEORDI I\\'ll take care of it, sir. PICARD Number One. (A beat) You have the bridge. He turns and heads toward his Ready Room. The others watch him go with great sadness. When the Ready Room doors close behind Picard, Deanna finally allows herself to cry. Riker holds her closely. Slow fade to... INT. ENTERPRISE. CREW LOUNGE. NIGHT. Hours later. The senior crew is solemnly gathered in the shattered remains of the crew lounge. Picard, Riker, Deanna, Beverly, Worf, Geordi. They wear their dress uniforms. Picard goes to each of them. He carries a small, metal box. They each take something from the box. At first we, don’t quite see what they are doing. \\'Then we realize they are affixing black bars to the collars of their uniforms. Mourning bands. Picard pours six glasses of his precious Chateau Picard. Each takes a glass. Picard raises his glass. PICARD To absent friends... To family. They toast Data. Slow fade to: INT. ENTERPRISE. PICARD\\'S CABIN. NIGHT. Picard sits at his desk, speaking quietly to someone we do not see. PICARD I don\\'t know if all this has made sense to you, but I wanted you to know what kind of man he was. In his quest to be more like us, he helped show us what it means to be human. We see it is the now re-activated B-9 sitting across from him. B-9 My brother was not a human. PICARD No, he wasn\\'t... But his wonder and his curiosity about every facet of human life helped all of us see the best parts of ourselves. He embraced change... because he always wanted to be more than he was. B-9 I do not understand. PICARD Well, I hope someday you will. Worf interrupts on comm: WORF (V.O. on com) Captain, the Hemingway has arrived to tow us to spacedock. PICARD On my way. Please notify Commander Riker. He stands, prepares to go. PICARD (Cont\\'d) We\\'ll talk later? The B-9 does not respond. He is looking rather blankly at padd on Picard\\'s desk. Picard begins to leave when a sound stops him... humming. He turns back to the B-9. The B-9 is still looking blankly at the padd... but he’s humming lightly to himself... then he begins to sing, very softly... B-9 \"Blue skies, smiling at me, Nothing but blue skies do I see.\" Then the B-9 is silent. Picard watches him for a moment; great emotion playing over his features, and then goes. INT. ENTERPRISE CORRIDOR. NIGHT. Picard and Riker head toward a turbolift making their way past the debris littering the corridor. PICARD I\\'m sorry you won\\'t be here for the re-fit, but I know the Titan needs you immediately. Riker does not respond. Picard stops, looks at Riker deeply. PICARD The Titan\\'s a fine ship, will. And she\\'s getting a captain worthy of her. RIKER She\\'s the most beautiful ship I’ve ever seen. Riker touches a wall of the corridor. RIKER (Cont\\'d) But she\\'s not the Enterprise. PICARD I promise you in time, she\\'ll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice? RIKER Anything. PICARD When your first officer insists that you can\\'t go on away missions... Ignore him. RIKER (Smiles) I intend to. A moment. RIKER (With difficulty) Serving with you has been an honor. PICARD The honor was mine. Captain Riker. EXT. ENTERPRISE. SPACEDOCK. OVER EARTH. A few weeks later. The Enterprise is enclosed in the great womb of a spacedock. The ship is being rebuilt. INT. ENTERPRISE. BRIDGE. NIGHT. A fresh-faced young officer, COMMANDER MARTIN MADDEN, paces nervously outside Picard\\'s Ready Room. Bracing himself before entering. Behind him we can see technicians working everywhere around the bridge, trying to rebuild it. Worf is talking to a young officer at tactical and Geordi is working at the engineering station. We also see new command chairs being installed. (Although we do not see it in this scene, the gaping hole at the front of the bridge has not yet been repaired.) A young Andorian woman, the new OPS OFFICER, smiles at Madden\\'s nervousness. Her antennae twitch slightly in amusement. He sees her. MADDEN So... what\\'s the old man like? OPS OFFICER Why don\\'t you go in and find out? Commander Madden prepares himself. INT. ENTERPRISE. READY ROOM. FOLLOWING. Picard is talking to Beverly on viewscreen. She is in her new office at Starfleet Medical. BEVERLY (On viewscreen) You can\\' t imagine them, Jean Luc. They\\'re kids! All with advance degrees in xenobiology and out to conquer every disease in the quadrant. PICARD (Smiles) Reminds me of a young doctor I used to know... BEVERLY (On viewscreen) They\\'re running me ragged. Nothing but question day and night... I love it! Come to dinner and 1\\'1 tell you all about it. There\\'s a Bajoran band at the officer\\'s mess. PICARD Not tonight, I have work here. BEVERLY (On viewscreen) Soon then. I’ll save the last dance for you. Commander Madden enters quickly -- he did not use the door chime so Picard is surprised. MADDEN Commander Martin Madden reporting for duty, sir. Picard stands, they shake hands as: PICARD Welcome aboard, Commander. I hope, your transfer didn\\'t come as too much of a surprise. MADDEN I was... honored, sir. PICARD I needed you immediately to help oversee the re-fit... (Gathering up some padds from his desk) Your service record on the Talos is exemplary, but there are a few things I would like to discuss with you regarding my requirements for a First Officer. Shall we say dinner in my quarters at 1900 hours? MADDEN Very good, sir. Picard heads toward the door, carrying a few padds. PICARD Commander, I don\\'t know how they did it on the Talos, but we have door chimes on the Enterprise. We use them. MADDEN Yes, sir. Sorry, sir. Picard goes to the bridge, Madden following. INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE. FOLLOWING. They emerge to the bridge as Worf is arguing with the cocky young ENSIGN busy installing Picard\\'s new high- tech command chair. WORF You don\\'t understand the Captain -- there should be no changes until we have discussed the modifications with him. Picard goes to them: PICARD What\\'s this? WORF (Grumbles) Your new chair, sir. ENSIGN It\\'s the Mark Seven, Captain. State-of-the-art ergonomics... command interfaces with -- WORF I told him you\\'re comfortable with your old chair. PICARD Let\\'s give it a try. He settles into his new command chair. Looks around for a beat at his new bridge crew. Fresh-faced kids. A new generation to teach and nurture. He smiles. PICARD Feels good. Worf and Geordi exchange a look, surprised. ENSIGN (Pointing) Try that button, sir. Picard presses a button on the chair and -- zip -- metal restraints fly into position around his waist and shoulders. Seatbelts! Picard is surprised. A beat. Then Picard smiles. PICARD It\\'s about time. He presses the button again and the restraints zip back into the body of the chair. He is delighted. He turns to Madden: PICARD Commander, please sit down. Madden sits in the First Officer\\'s chair, Picard shares a padd with him. PICARD (Cont\\'d) We\\'ve received our first assignment. We\\'re going to be exploring the Denab system. It should be exciting. It\\'s a place... where no one has gone before. And we cut to: EXT. ENTERPRISE SPACEDOCK. OVER EARTH. FOLLOWING. Through the hole in the hull we see Picard talking to Madden. Picard at work, at peace. Where he is meant to be. We slowly pull back from Picard and the Enterprise. As we hear the B-9\\'s soft tones. Gentle. Hopeful. B-9 (V.O.) \"Never saw the sun shining so bright, Never saw things going so right. Noticing the days hurrying by, When you\\'re in love, my how they fly. Blue days, all of them gone, Nothing but blue skies from now on.\" We revolve away from the Enterprise and Earth toward the stars. Then ZOOM forward into the cosmos as the rousing \"Next Generation\" theme explodes over END CREDITS.'"

       "'Screenplay by Michael Pillar & Rick Berman REV. FINAL DRAFT March 12, 1998 FADE IN: 1 TALL GRASS BLOWING GENTLY IN A BREEZE - DAY - (OPTICAL) 1 The sound of children playing, running through the grass... as one boy (ARTIM, 12) pokes his head out, we see by his facial skin pattern that he\\'s an alien... his cloths are simple, homespun. As other alien children pursue him in a game of tag into the rocky foothills, we BOOM UP to reveal a breathtaking view of a rural community along a vast sparkling lake... mountains rising in the background...some odd-like livestock graze on the hillside... 2 A FARM - LONG SHOT 2 A woman uses a bike pump to get well water...a man works the soil in his fields, wipes his brow, waving to -- 3 A WOMAN (ANIJ, 38) 3 whose beauty immediately captivates us as she strolls past the farm, the wind barely jostling her close cut curly hair. She takes us to a busy outdoor farmers market at the edge of a hand-constructed village set against a natural rock face barrier. These are the Ba\\'ku people and from the opening shots we can feel the simple charms of this beautiful place... and who would blame us for wanting to be there, to escape a life like this... where people seem to have all the time in the world... to chat with neighbors, taste a piece of fresh fruit and enjoy the day... Anij nods hello to people including SOJEF (male, 42), the community leader... she smiles as a vendor slices a piece of fruit for her... 4 NEW ANGLE - ANIJ - (OPTICAL) 4 From the point of view of the rock face behind the village. Although we may not realize it yet, we are watching through a window now... slightly discolored, pulling back to see a mysterious figure in an isolation suit standing incongruously beside her, his suit glowing with a green force field. None of the Ba\\'ku are aware of him as he takes readings with a sophisticated sensor device built into his suit. Now our pullback reveals we\\'re inside a duck blind. Low lighting levels. A bi- level gallery of Starfleet officers and members of an alien race (the Son\\'a) observe the peaceful village scene like sportswriters at the ballpark... 5-9 VARIOUS ANGLES 5-9 as they enter data into their computers. Supernumeraries move in and out of the main viewing room with PADDS... 10 ANGLE TO INCLUDE THE FULL WINDOW (OPTICAL) 10 Outside, several other cloaked figures move among the unknowing Ba\\'ku... 11 ANGLE - THE RANKING SON\\'A OFFICER (GALLATIN, 60) 11 (OPTICAL) Inside the duck blind. Like all Son\\'a, his face is stretched like a rubber band about to snap...they look like victims of three too many cosmetic surgeries. He studies a PADD from a supernumerary... GALLATIN Admiral Dougherty is waiting for this. Transmit it to the ship. Suddenly a communications crackle on loudspeakers... MALE SON\\'A COM VOICE Alert, area twelve...! Now the sound of a weapon blast... turmoil...As the blast echoes through the hills, the Ba\\'ku outside the window react, turn their heads toward the sound... MALE SON\\'A COM VOICE (distressed) ... the android has... It crackles off... Gallatin moves to a companel... LIEUTENANT Data, report to base immediately. DATA\\'S COM VOICE Transferring... positronic... matrix functions... engaging... secondary protocols... The running man starts pulling at his headgear. STARFLEET OFFICER #1 He\\'s trying to remove the headpiece... GALLATIN All field units. Intercept the android. 12 OMITTED 12 THRU THRU 15 15 16 ANGLE - THROUGH WINDOW - (OPTICAL) 16 as all the men in suits converge on the running man... but with superhuman strength, he tosses them aside with ease... Meanwhile Ba\\'ku people, unaware of the fight, greet their children back, happy they\\'re safe... 17 EXT. MARKET - CONTINUOUS (OPTICAL) - ANGLE ON ARTIM 17 as he moves to Sojef, his father... SOJEF It must have been some kind of odd electrical storm... But as Sojef speaks, Artim turns to see the floating head of Data DECLOAKING in mid-air barely a yard away as he removes his helmet... the boy yells... jumps back, falling as Data makes eye contact with him. The Ba\\'ku scatter... Sojef pulls the boy away to safety... DATA Secondary protocols... active. We notice a slashing burn wound on Data\\'s neck as he fights off an invisible force again... we hear a ripping crunch and a green force field sputters briefly -- a Son\\'a man in a torn isolation suit partially DECLOAKS as he is slammed to the ground, unconscious. Data rips off the rest of his suit revealing himself, picks up a weapon from the unconscious Son\\'a, aims it at the rock face... 18 INT. DUCK BLIND - (OPTICAL) 18 The observers dive for cover as he points the weapon this way. But Data fires it to the left of the window... 19 EXT. ROCK FACE - (OPTICAL) 19 And then fires again to the right... and again above... each hit knocking out generators... finally the rock face shimmers, like a computer image breaking up, and disappears revealing the high-tech stations behind it... 20 ANGLE (OPTICAL) 20 All the invisible men in suits DECLOAK in the village. 21 THROUGH THE DUCK BLIND WINDOW 21 The scientists begin to poke their heads up from the floor... exposed to the world outside... 22 THE BA\\'KU IN HIDING PLACES 22 including Anij, Artim and Sojef react with shock... VARIOUS BA\\'KU What is it? Who are they? 23 DATA 23 stands alone, satisfied with his mysterious work. 24 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE - (OPTICAL) 24 In orbit of an M-class planet. 25 INT. PICARD\\'S QUARTERS 25 Close on the four Captain\\'s pips on his uniform, and moving back to reveal BEVERLY CRUSHER helping JEAN-LUC PICARD fasten the collar on his jacket as DEANNA TROI briefs him, glancing at a PADD. All are wearing formal uniforms. They are running late. TROI ... Population three hundred million... PICARD Say the greeting again... TROI Yew-cheen chef-faw... emphasis on the \\'cheen\\' and the \\'faw\\'... CRUSHER You either need a new uniform or a new neck. PICARD \\'Yew-cheen chef-faw\\'... My collar size is exactly the same as it was at the Academy. CRUSHER (dry) Sure it is. And your hair is still chestnut brown. Our angle clearly establishes Picard\\'s white hair... she finishes with the collar... overlapping the above dialogue: a chime at the door, Troi answers it, letting in WILL RIKER in his dress uniform. RIKER Our guests have arrived and are eating the floral arrangements on the banquet tables... CRUSHER I guess they don\\'t believe in cocktails before dinner... As Picard leads the way out of the door... TROI (looking at her PADD) Oh, my God, are they vegetarians? That\\'s not in here... PICARD Better have the chef whip up a light balsamic vinaigrette... something that goes well with chrysanthemums... 26 INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS 26 Very up-tempo dialogue... PICARD (CONT\\'D) PERIM\\'S COM VOICE Yew-cheen chef-faw... Bridge to Captain Picard... PICARD Yes, Ensign... PERIM\\'S COM VOICE Command wants to know our ETA at the Goren systsem... PICARD (to Riker) The Goren system...? RIKER They need us to mediate some territorial dispute... PICARD (frustrated) We can\\'t delay the archaeological expedition to Hanoran Two. It would put us into the middle of monsoon season... RIKER (can\\'t be helped) The Diplomatic Corps is busy with Dominion negotiations. PICARD (sighs) ... so they need us to put out one more brush fire. (beat) Anyone remember when we used to be explorers? They enter... 27 INT. TURBOLIFT - CONTINUOUS 27 PICARD (refocussing) \\'Yew-cheen chef-faw.\\' RIKER Deck ten. TROI (resuming her briefing) Remember; they have a significantly less advanced technology than ours... they only achieved warp drive last year... CRUSHER A year? And the Federation Coucil decided to make them a Protectorate already? PICARD In view of our losses to the Borg and the Dominion, the Coucil feels we need all the allies we can get these days. As the turbolift doors open, we see much activity, can hear music coming from the party... Picard puts on a brighter face. As they exit... TROI You\\'ll be expected to dance with Regent Cuzar... CRUSHER Can she mambo...? PICARD Very funny... CRUSHER (off Riker & Troi\\'s reactions) Your Captain used to cut quite a rug... 28 INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS 28 Several officers in dress uniform move to make room for the Captain\\'s entourage... moving with them... FEMALE ENSIGN Captain on deck! LA FORGE\\'S COM VOICE La Forge to Picard. Captain, I need to talk to you before you go into the reception... Before Picard can respond, he runs into Worf... WORF Captain... PICARD Worf, what the hell are you doing here? WORF RIKER I was at the Manzar colony It\\'s a little late, installing a new defense Geordi... can it wait? perimeter when I heard the Enterprise was in this sector... PICARD LA FORGE\\'S COM VOICE Stop by my quarters later; I don\\'t think so I have a few ideas about Commander.. Manzar security... (non-stop to Riker) Have him come to the reception... we\\'ll talk here... Picard moves into the banquet room, continuing to Worf -- PICARD RIKER How\\'s your bride? The Captain wants you to come over. WORF LA FORGE\\'S COM VOICE A challenge I\\'m on my way... tell him we\\'ve recieved a PICARD communique from Admiral Then you were made for Dougherty... each other. LA FORGE\\'S COM VOICE (CONT\\'D) It\\'s about Data. 29 INT. BANQUET ROOM 29 Maybe thirty Starfleet officers, most human but a few Bajorans, Trills and Borians peppered about... a small group of musicians play a festive tune. The crowd moves back as their Captain enters and Troi escorts him to REGENT CUZAR, 50 and her delegation of about eight extremely short aliens... she\\'s at least a foot shorter than he is... PICARD Yew-cheen chef-faw, Regent Cuzar. Welcome aboard the Enterprise. CUZAR Captain Picard, may I welcome you in the time-honored tradition of my people... An aide steps forward and she takes an alien headpiece from him and reaches up to put it on Picard\\'s head... Picard has to make himself shorter to make it work... the other aliens throw tiny seeds over Picard and Cuzar (like rice at a wedding)... Picard smiles, trying not to show how silly he feels... CUZAR We are so honored to be accepted within the great Federation family. (excusing him) Please, I know you have other guests to greet... PICARD We have a dance later, I believe? CUZAR I look forward to it. One of her misters escorts her away, Picard turns to Troi - PICARD How are we supposed to dance? Her head will be in my... He\\'s interrupted by GEORDI LA FORGE who approaches looking concerned, holding a PADD, hands it to Picard... LA FORGE Excuse me, sir. Admiral Dougherty\\'s aboard the Son\\'a ship in sector four-four-one. He\\'s requesting Data\\'s schematics... TROI Is something wrong? LA FORGE The message doesn\\'t say. PICARD (concerned) Data should have been back by now. They were only scheduled to observe the Ba\\'ku village for a week. (to Geordi) Set up a secured com-link to the Admiral in the anteroom... Geordi acknowledges, moves away... a Bolian science officer grabs Picard by the arm... BOLIAN OFFICER Captain, Hars Adislo, we met at the Nel Bato Conference last year... did you ever have a chance to read my paper on thermionic transconductance...? As Picard reacts, smiling with no recollection... 30 A MONITOR -- INT. ANTEROOM OFF BANQUET ROOM - (OPTICAL) 30 Admiral MATTHEW DOUGHERTY, 69, a confident, charismatic officer is transmitting from a Son\\'a ship. DOUGHERTY He\\'s not acknowledging any Starfleet protocols... not responding to any of our hails... We pull back to see we\\'re in a small room off the reception... Picard faces the monitor (he\\'s removed the headpiece). Geordi observes. A Starfleet Ensign stands guard just outside the door to make sure they\\'re not disturbed. PICARD You have no idea what precipitated his behavior? DOUGHERTY (shakes his head) ... And now he\\'s holding our people hostage down there... PICARD The Enterprise can be at your position in two days, Admiral... DOUGHERTY That\\'s probably not a good idea. Your ship hasn\\'t been fitted for this region; there are environmental concerns... PICARD What kind of concerns? DOUGHERTY We haven\\'t fully identified the anomalies yet. They\\'re calling this whole area The Briar Patch... it took us a day to reach a location where we could get a signal out to you. Just get me Data\\'s schematics. I\\'ll keep you informed. (Picard acknowledges) Dougherty out. The screen returns to a starfield. PICARD Send him the schematics. Geordi acknowledges. PICARD Ensign... ENSIGN (moving inside) Sir? PICARD Report to the galley and tell the chef to skip the fish course. The Ensign gives a puzzled reaction but an order is an order. He exits. Geordi gives his Captain a curious look. PICARD I want our guests to depart as quickly a etiquette allows. I\\'ll ask Worf to delay his return to DS9 so he can join us. We\\'re going to stop by sector four-four- one on our way to the Goren system. LA FORGE (understanding) They... are in opposite directions, sir... PICARD (dry) Are they...? La Forge smiles, leaves. Picard takes a beat to collect himself and we may sense how the clutter in a Captain\\'s life may wear him down. He puts the alien headpiece back on with sullen eyes... then restores his diplomat\\'s face and returns to the reception... 31 EXT. SPACE - SON\\'A SHIP - (OPTICAL) 31 moving toward a ringed planet well in the distance, passing slowly through wisps of space matter... wonderful, glowing plasma tendrils like legs of a gigantic tarantula dotted by low density gas clouds... 32 INT. SON\\'A SHIP BODY ENHANCEMENT FACILITY - (OPTICAL) 32 Low lighting. Strange futuristic dialysis machines pump fluids in and out of reclined Son\\'a men and women... the women use powder and heavy but carefully applied make-up to obscure their faces. Son\\'a costumes are made of expensive fabrics with latinum chains and exquisite jewels as accessories, suggesting a wealthy culture that values materialism. Sexy female attendants from various alien races, dressed provocatively, work with laser tools to repair cracked, raw skin off Son\\'a faces. We move to find RU\\'AFO, 63, the Son\\'a Ahdar (Commander), reclining getting an elaborate facial from two beauties, creams and oils massaged into his skin by their gentle fingertips... RU\\'AFO I should have never let you talk me into the duck blind in the first place... Reveal Admiral Dougherty observing, wearing a crisp, Starfleet uniform... he looks and feels out of place here, but such are the demands of alien alliances... RU\\'AFO (CONT\\'D) Your Federation procedures have made this mission ten times as difficult as it needed to be... DOUGHERTY Our procedures were in place to protect the planet\\'s population from unnecessary risk... RU\\'AFO Planet\\'s population. Six hundred people. You want to avoid unnecessary risks? Next time leave your android home. SON\\'A OFFICER #1\\'S COM VOICE Bridge to Ahdar Ru\\'afo. We\\'re approaching the planet. He motions to the girls to finish up, presses his personal comlink, answering the call... RU\\'AFO Take us into a high orbit. (as he rises from the chair) Lie down, Admiral. The girls will take twenty years off your face... DOUGHERTY Another time. Ru\\'afo studies his own face in the mirror... RU\\'AFO Your self-restraint puzzles me, Admiral. You continue to deny yourself every benefit this mission has to offer... DOUGHERTY I prefer to wait until we can share the benefits with all the people of the Federation... Suddenly, boom! The ship is hit by a blast. Ru\\'afo reacts, leads the way out.... 33 INT. SON\\'A BRIDGE - (OPTICAL) 33 As Ru\\'afo and Dougherty enter... RU\\'AFO Report. SON\\'A OFFICER #1 Phaser blast. Unknown origin. RU\\'AFO Raise shields. (another blast) Take us out of orbit. SON\\'A OFFICER #2 Photon torpedoes. Brace for impact! Blam... again... and again... serious hits... SON\\'A COMPUTER VOICE Warning. Outer hull damage, deck three... SON\\'A OFFICER #1 Visual contact! On the viewscreen the attacking ship moves suddenly into view from a low density gas cloud like a destroyer emerging from a fog bank... it is a Federation Scout ship -- small but impressive, with windows at the forward cockpit... the Admiral reacts... DOUGHERTY That\\'s our ship. 34 EXT. SPACE - CLOSE VIEW: THE SCOUT - (OPTICAL) 34 as it moves at us, firing one last blast which illuminates the pilot for a instant and we clearly see the face of Data through the window... 35 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE - (OPTICAL) 35 at warp, in normal space... 36 INT. PICARD\\'S QUARTERS - (OPTICAL) 36 Close on the replicator. An allegro chamber music piece in the background... PICARD (O.C.) Tea. Earl Grey. Hot. The tea appears as we pull back to reveal Picard studying a PADD... he reaches out for the tea without his eyes ever leaving his reading... walks across the room and sits at a dining table that has stacks of various work materials... more PADDS, charts and graphs and maps... a half-eaten salad sits in front of him... and in a move that would challenge the world\\'s greatest juggler, he pokes a fork of salad into his mouth with one hand as he sips his tea with the other, finding a spot to prop the PADD so he can still read... and now, his mind, asking a silent question, reaching over to grab a chart, and as he pulls it over, he also spills the salad plate splashing gorgonzolla dressing over his jacket... sighs... a chime at the door... PICARD Who is it? RIKER (O.C.) Commander Riker... Picard looks at himself, shrugs, what the hell... PICARD Come... Riker enters with a PADD, eyes drawn to Picard\\'s stained jacket... PICARD I\\'m the casualty of a working lunch. Picard takes off his jacket... and as the scene continues, he changes. PICARD (CONT\\'D) I\\'ve been going over the few star charts we have of this \"Briar Patch\". It\\'s full of supernova remnants, false vacuum fluctuations... Riker looks at the star chart, brushes it off... RIKER ... and gorgonzolla cheese. PICARD We won\\'t be able to go any faster than one-third impulse in that muck... RIKER (handing him the PADD) Nothing dangerous turned up in the astrometric survey... PICARD So where are the \\'environmental concerns\\' the Admiral was talking about? RIKER (shrugs) The only unusual readings were low levels of metaphasic radiation from interstellar dust across the region... WORF\\'S COM VOICE Bridge to Captain Picard. We are approaching sector four-four-one. PICARD Slow to impulse. We\\'re on our way. Picard leads the way out... 37 EXT. SPACE - THE BRIAR PATCH - (OPTICAL) 37 The edge of the dangerous and beautiful region... moving to find the Enterprise approaching at impulse... 38 INT. BRIDGE - (OPTICAL) 38 Seeing the Patch on the viewscreen... Worf at tactical, ENSIGN KELL PERIM, female Trill, 29, at Conn... Troi at command, La Forge at Ops... as Picard and Riker enter... LA FORGE We\\'re about to lose communications with Starfleet, Captain. PICARD (to Troi) Do you have everything you need from command? TROI We\\'ve downloaded all the files on the duck blind mission as well as intelligence reports on the Son\\'a. PICARD (including Riker) You have two days to become experts... Mister Worf, your job and mine will be to find a plan to safely capture Data. Worf holds up a modified tricorder... WORF I\\'ve already modified a tricorder with one of his spare actuation servos. Its operational range is only seven meters but it should shut him down... PICARD (appreciating his initiative) It\\'s good to have you back, Worf. (he sits) Slow to one-third. Take us in. 39 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE - (OPTICAL) 39 as it moves slowly into The Patch. 40 INT. ENTERPRISE LIBRARY 40 Significantly electronic... many computer stations... a few real books... Troi and Riker work at parallel computer stations... people are at other stations... TROI (off her computer) The Son\\'a discovered an M-class planet with humanoid life six months ago. Turned out it\\'s in us to get approval for a sociological study. The Federation Council suggested it be a joint mission... RIKER Why was Data assigned? TROI \"Environmental concerns\", again. An android could be safely exposed to the elements during the installation of a duck blind... LIBRARIAN(C.O.) Sssshhh... They turn to see -- a middle-aged, prune-faced woman at a desk, looking sternly at them... Troi goes back to her reading but seems distracted... sees a paper notepad on the desk, rips off a shred and, during the following exchange, starts to press it between her thumb and forefinger into a little ball. Whispering now -- RIKER I don\\'t see anything to suggest the Son\\'a have any interest in sociology... TROI What are they interested in...? RIKER Wine, women and song. TROI You should feel right at home with them. She throws the ball of paper and hits Riker on the side of the head... he turns but she\\'s looking innocently at her screen... he rolls a little paper ball himself... RIKER Nomadic, collectors of precious metals, jewels... TROI (joking) Hmm, I should feel right at home with them... RIKER You\\'re in luck... it says here they\\'ve taken women from several races as indentured servants. Just as he\\'s about to throw his paper ball back at her... he sees the librarian staring at him... Riker, caught, sheepishly turns back to his computer... a beat... RIKER (reacts) Look at this... She stands, leaning over Riker\\'s shoulder to see his computer, putting one arm on the desk... RIKER (CONT\\'D) \\'The Son\\'a have been suspected of producing mass quantities of the narcotic ketracel-white... their ships are rumored to be equipped with isolytic subspace weapons outlawed by the Second Khitomer Accord...\\' 41 ANGLE EMPHASIZING HER BREAST 41 as it rests gently on his upper arm... and he\\'s deeply aware of that breast touching him... TROI Why would we be involved with these people? RIKER Good question. They exchange a brief glance that has nothing to do with the Son\\'a. As his eyes return to the computer scrolling, she casually plays with hair at the nape of his neck... RIKER You haven\\'t done that in a long time... TROI What...? RIKER What you\\'re doing to my neck... TROI (flirtatiously) Was I doing something to your neck? He pauses his scrolling as he comes to something curious... RIKER It says here that some form of genetic damage has apparently prevented the Son\\'a from procreating... TROI No children? RIKER If that\\'s true, they\\'re a dying race. Suddenly, a tiny ball of paper hits Riker... RIKER Hey... He turns to see an alien ensign looking too innocently at his computer. The librarian\\'s eyes fix on Riker and Troi, obvious troublemakers... Troi points to Riker... TROI He started it. Riker reacts, starts to leave... Troi follows... RIKER I didn\\'t do anything, I swear it. 41A EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL) 41A As it continues slowly through The Briar Patch... 42 INT. WORF\\'S QUARTERS 42 Dark. Worf asleep in bed, an alarm already beeping... PICARD\\'S COM VOICE Bridge to Commander Worf... Worf begins to stir... then his eyes open and he realizes the alarm is going off... he sits up... PICARD\\'S COM VOICE Worf? WORF Captain? PICARD\\'S COM VOICE I don\\'t know how they do it on Deep Space Nine... but on the Enterprise, we still report for duty on time. Worf stands in the dark, bumping his head as he does... INTERCUT: 43 INT. BRIDGE 43 Picard at command... La Forge at Ops... Perim at conn... LIEUTENANT NARA, human male, 35, at Tactical... WORF\\'S COM VOICE I... I must have slept through my alarm. I\\'m on my way... PICARD We\\'ll skip the court martial this time... Picard out. A beat as Picard listens to the sound of his ship, raises an eyebrow... we hear nothing... he moves forward to La Forge and Perim... PICARD When was the last time we aligned our torque sensors... PERIM Two months ago, sir... PICARD They don\\'t sound right. La Forge and Perim react, work the controls, exchange a look at the results... LA FORGE The torque sensors are out of alignment... by twelve microns... you could hear that? PICARD (pleased with himself) When I was an ensign, I could detect a three-micron mis- alignment... NARA Excuse me, sir. The Son\\'a ship with Admiral Dougherty aboard has entered tracking range... PICARD Try to hail them. A disheveled and embarrassed Worf enters... NARA Admiral Dougherty responding. Worf replaces Nara... PICARD Straighten your baldric, Commander. On screen... 44 ANGLE - INCLUDE THE VIEWSCREEN - (OPTICAL) 44 Dougherty and Ru\\'afo are sitting in Ru\\'afo\\'s tactical room, opulently decorated for a spaceship. DOUGHERTY Captain, I wasn\\'t expecting you. PICARD This was too important for the Enterprise to be on the sidelines, Admiral... DOUGHERTY I wish I had better news. Commander Data attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday. Ru\\'afo and I have decided to send in an assault team... PICARD Sir, Commander Worf and I have been working on several tactical plans to safely... RU\\'AFO Your android has turned dangerously violent, Captain... Considerable damage was done to my ship. He must be destroyed. DOUGHERTY I know what Data means to Starfleet, Jean-Luc... but our crew is at the mercy of those people on the planet... PICARD If our first attempt to capture Data fails, I will terminate him. (beat) I should be the one to do it. I\\'m his Captain. And his friend. Dougherty pauses to consider but Ru\\'afo wants none of Picard. RU\\'AFO It isn\\'t safe for you to remain in this area. DOUGHERTY He\\'s right. Our shields have been upgraded to protect against the environmental anomalies... PICARD We haven\\'t noticed any ill effects. The Admiral studies him a long beat, is sympathetic to Picard\\'s position. DOUGHERTY All right. You have twelve hours, Captain. Then I want you out of The Briar Patch. In the meantime, we\\'ll be heading out to the perimeter to call for Son\\'a reinforcements in case you fail. PICARD Understood. DOUGHERTY Good luck. Dougherty out. His image disappears. On Picard\\'s expression... 45 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE - (OPTICAL) 45 As the bay door slides open and a shuttle emerges... moves through the gas clouds toward the beautiful ringed planet... 46 INT. SHUTTLE - (OPTICAL) 46 Worf and Picard at the controls... WORF Sensors are not picking up any ships coming from the surface... PICARD Transmit a wide band co-variant signal. That\\'ll get his attention. WORF (touches panel) He might be using the planet\\'s rings to mask his approach. PICARD (off sensors) The metaphasic radiation in those rings is in a state of extreme flux. Steer clear of them, Mister Worf... A beat. Watching and waiting. PICARD Come out, come out wherever you are... WORF Sir? PICARD Hmm? Oh, it\\'s just something my mother used to... Suddenly, wham -- a blast... PICARD Hold on. He hits the controls and they climb sharply... 47 EXT. SPACE - THE SHUTTLE - (OPTICAL) 47 evading phaser shots form the scout... the planet providing a dramatic backdrop... 48 INT.

Gas shoots from the ceiling... Worf tries to stop it... 58 THROUGH THE WINDOW - (OPTICAL) 58 to see the Scout zooming past, so close that Picard and Data can even make eye contact... Picard works to avoid him again... PICARD He can fly a ship, he anticipates tactical strategies, his brain is obviously functioning... We\\'ve seen how he responds to threats. I wonder how he\\'d respond to... Another shot connects... PICARD (a new idea) Do you know Gilbert and Sullivan? WORF No, sir. I haven\\'t had a chance to meet all the new crew members since I\\'ve been back... PICARD They\\'re composers, Worf, from the nineteenth century. Data was rehearsing a part in H.M.S. Pinafore before he left... (singing to com) \"A British tar is a soaring soul, As free as a mountain bird, His energetic first should be ready to resist A dictatorial word...\" Picard looks at Worf, nods, join me!

VILLAGE - DAY (OPTICAL) 81 The hostages are sitting at wooden tables with the Ba\\'ku having lunch, the Son\\'a quietly keeping to themselves at separate tables. To the side, Artim and friends play a game (TBD) that displays extraordinary hand-eye coordination, well beyond human abilities. 82 ANGLE - PICARD, TROI AND CRUSHER 82 and several engineers enter the village on foot, phasers drawn, their faces curious at the picnic before them... the hum of conversation fades... for a moment, it almost seems that the hostages are sorry to seem them... Gallatin and the Starfleet lieutenant move to Picard... GALLATIN Captain, Subahdar Gallatin, Son\\'a Command. LIEUTENANT Lieutenant Curtis, attach, to Admiral Dougherty. PICARD Are you all right? LIEUTENANT We\\'ve been treated extremely well by these people. The children have resumed their game. Troi observes them with keen interest... Picard notices... PICARD Counselor? TROI They have an incredible clarity of perception, Captain. I\\'ve never encountered a species with such mental discipline... Sojef, Anij and several of the Ba\\'ku, including another village leader, TOURNEL (35), move toward them. SOJEF My name is Sojef, Captain. PICARD Jean-Luc Picard... my officers Doctor Crusher and Counselor Troi. SOJEF Would you like something to eat? PICARD No, we\\'re here to... rescue them. SOJEF As you wish. But I would ask you to disarm yourselves. This village is a sanctuary of life. Picard measures the request... then holsters his phaser... the rest of the away team does the same... PICARD (to Crusher and Troi) Prepare to transport the \\'hostages\\' to the ship... CRUSHER They should be quarantined before joining the ship\\'s population. Picard nods. They move off with Gallatin and the Lieutenant. The work crew moves to disassemble the duck blind. PICARD (to Sojef) We were under the impression they were being held against their will. ANIJ It\\'s not our custom to have guests here at all, let alone hold anyone against their will. Picard makes eye contact with Anij... her tone is not harsh, but we can sense an inner strength in this woman. SOJEF The artificial lifeform would not allow them to leave. He told us they were our enemies and more would follow. ANIJ Are you our enemy? SOJEF Anij... PICARD My people have a strict policy of non-interference with other cultures. In fact, it\\'s our Prime Directive. ANIJ (dry, with a smile) Your directive apparently doesn\\'t include spying on other cultures. PICARD If I were in your shoes, I\\'d feel the same way after what happened. (beat) The \\'artificial lifeform\\' is a member of my crew. Apparently, he became... ill... TOURNEL There did seem to be a phase variance in the positronic matrix that we were unable to repair. Picard reacts, not the sort of thing one expects to hear from someone in a place like this... ANIJ I believe the Captain finds it hard to believe that we\\'d have any skills repairing a positronic device... SOJEF Our technological abilities aren\\'t apparent because we\\'ve chosen not to employ them in our daily lives. We believe when you create a machine to do the work of a man, you take something away from the man. ANIJ (don\\'t take us lightly) But at one time, we explored the galaxy just as you do... PICARD You have warp capability? ANIJ Capability, yes. But where can warp drive take us, except away from here...? Clearly establishing that she and her people have very little interest in life beyond their world. Picard allows himself to take in this glorious setting... a humming bird hovers briefly nearby... it is the kind of paradise that would appeal to any contemporary man trying to escape the clutter of his life if only for a brief respite... and at least, to that extent -- PICARD I understand. In the background, the Starfleet hostages embrace their hosts as they say farewell... PICARD I apologize for our intrusion. 83 INT. READY ROOM - (OPTICAL) 83 Picard talks to Dougherty on a monitor... PICARD ... and because they have warp capabilities, the consequences to their society are minimal... DOUGHERTY You\\'ve done a terrific job, Jean- Luc. Now, pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How\\'s Data? PICARD In stasis. La Forge is completing the diagnostic. DOUGHERTY (acknowledge) I\\'ll need all your paperwork tomorrow. We\\'re heading back your way. Set a course to rendezvous with us so you can transfer the crew and equipment on your way out. PICARD You\\'re not finished here? DOUGHERTY Just a few loose ends to tie up. Dougherty out. Picard turns off the monitor, glances at the pile of work PADDS -- his \"paperwork\" -- on his desk without pleasure... picks one up and begins to study it for a beat... then is drawn to the window, where he can see the warm inviting planet below. 84 INT. TROI\\'S OFFICE 84 She\\'s sitting on the sofa making some notes on a PADD when the door chimes... TROI Come in. (Riker enters) Hi. RIKER Got a minute? I... need a little counseling. (off her surprise) First time for everything. Do I... lie down... or what? TROI Whatever makes you comfortable... Riker lies down, only he winds up with his head on her lap looking up at her... TROI This isn\\'t one of the usual therapeutic postures... RIKER But it\\'s comfortable. TROI Why don\\'t you try sitting up? RIKER Or you could try lying down. TROI You\\'re in quite a mood today. He finally sits up, stealing a kiss along the way... she rises shocked but not upset... TROI Do you really need counseling or did you come down here to play? Riker is on his feet now, approaching her. She retreats. RIKER Both. (off her look) I think I\\'m having a mid-life crisis... TROI (retreating) ... I believe you... RIKER ... I\\'m not sleeping well... TROI ... Doctor Crusher has something that\\'ll take care of that... She allows him to catch her... RIKER What I need, I can\\'t get from Doctor Crusher... (inches away) Counselor, do you think it\\'s possible for two people to go back in time to fix a mistake they\\'ve made? TROI On this ship, anything can happen. And usually does. He closes the gap between them, kisses her deeply. TROI Augh. RIKER Augh? TROI I never kissed you with a beard before. She pushes him out the door... RIKER I kiss you and you say \\'augh\\'?! She hits the panel and the door slides closed in his face... a tiny grin comes to her face... 85 INT. ENGINEERING CORRIDOR - MOVING WITH PICARD & 85 LA FORGE La Forge has a headache he\\'s trying to work through... he shows Picard several burned components... LA FORGE I took these out of Data\\'s neural net... they contain memory engrams... PICARD Do you know how they were damaged? LA FORGE By a Son\\'a weapon. (off Picard\\'s look) There\\'s no doubt about it, sir. That\\'s what made Data malfunction. PICARD The Son\\'a reports claim they didn\\'t fire until after he malfunctioned. LA FORGE I don\\'t believe it happened that way. PICARD Why would they fire at him without provocation? LA FORGE All I know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot. Then, his fail-safe system was activated... PICARD Fail-safe? LA FORGE His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions... PICARD So, you\\'re saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong. LA FORGE In a sense, that\\'s all he knew. The system is designed to protect him against anyone who might try to take advantage of his memory loss. PICARD And yet he attacked us. And told the Ba\\'ku we were a threat... \\'Why?\\' is the unspoken question on Picard\\'s face. 86 ANGLE 86 They reach a door with a significant security system in place... Geordi hits several panels... Picard notices his eye discomfort... PICARD Implants bothering you? LA FORGE It\\'s nothing. I\\'m just tired. The door slides open to reveal a closet-sized space with Data mounted on the wall in a diagnostic device... Geordi touches a panel which activates Data... PICARD Hello, Data... DATA Captain, Geordi...? PICARD You\\'re aboard the Enterprise. LA FORGE You\\'ve had a serious malfunction. DATA (going inward a beat) I seem to be missing several memory engrams... Geordi holds up the damaged components for him to see. DATA Yes... that looks like them. PICARD What\\'s the last thing you remember, Data... DATA (searching his memory, signs) \\'his nose should pant and his lip should curl...\\' PICARD From the mission... DATA I was in an isolation suit collecting physiometric data on Ba\\'ku children. My last memory is going into the hills, following a boy... 87 EXT. VILLAGE - DAY - (OPTICAL) 87 Artim is playing with a tiny \\'palm-pet\\', a colorful cross between a caterpillar and a jellyfish that crawls over his hand and between his fingers, as Sojef moves over with Picard and Data... the boy looks at Data with fear in his eyes. Data can\\'t help but notice... SOJEF Artim, do you remember where you were on the day of lightning when the artificial lifeform appeared to us? ARTIM In the hills, by the dam. PICARD Can you show us? Artim puts his pet in a pocket (or it can have its own little pouch on Artim\\'s belt if he has no pockets) and leads the way. Several Ba\\'ku including Anij and Tournel curiously follow. As Picard makes eye contact with her, she moves over... ANIJ Haven\\'t you disrupted our lives enough...? She says it gently, but honestly... PICARD I understand how you feel. We just want to retrace Data\\'s movements that day... ANIJ Why? PICARD (a cautious reply) I don\\'t like to leave questions unanswered. ANIJ (evenly) Then you must spend your life answering questions. She moves away. Picard watches her; she doesn\\'t look back. 88 ANGLE ON DATA 88 Who notices Artim still glancing at him with fear. To reassure him -- DATA There is no need for concern. I am operating within normal parameters now. ARTIM You\\'re what? DATA I am better. The android\\'s manner only seems to frighten Artim more. Before Data can say anything else, Sojef comes and leads him away, giving Data a cool smile that says, in effect, I don\\'t want any artificial lifeform talking to my son. Data reacts. After a thoughtful beat, moves to walk with Picard. DATA I believe the boy is... afraid... of me. PICARD It\\'s nothing personal data. You have to remember these people have rejected technology. And you... DATA ... I am the personification of everything they have rejected. PICARD Until this week, that young man probably never saw a machine, let alone one that walks and talks... DATA And I do not believe I made a very good first impression. It clearly bothers Data to be the object of fear. The boy glances over his shoulder once more at the android, looks quickly away... 89 LONG SHOT 89 as the group moves into the rocky foothills... 90 PICARD 90 enchanted by the natural beauty, the antithesis of clutter. 91 NEW ANGEL 91 They come to a brook. Artim hops on one foot across rocks in the water and without stopping to think, Picard does the same thing, looking like a little boy... then notices a curious look from Data which makes him collect himself and adjust his jacket. Anij glances over at Sojef with concern. The others cross in adult fashion. 92 COMING OVER A RISE 92 ARTIM I saw the first bolt of lightning over there... As they move along the rise... 93 INT. RIKER\\'S QUARTERS - BATHROOM 93 Close on a 24th century container of Gillette Foamy Shaving Cream (\"For weightless Environments!\")... finding a female hand with a straight razor moving to Riker\\'s face... his chin and cheeks lathered with cream... and the hand is Troi\\'s and they\\'re in the bathtub together in a bubble bath... she expertly moves the blade across his face, leaving a swath of bare chin... WORF\\'S COM VOICE Bridge to Riker. RIKER Can I get back to you, Worf? WORF\\'S COM VOICE Admiral Dougherty\\'s on the com- link, sir. RIKER (sighs) Patch him through. (the computer bleeps) Yes, Admiral. 94 INT. SON\\'A BODY FACILITY 94 Dougherty in the foreground; behind him a Son\\'a physician is pulling green scum from subcutaneous boils under the skin of Ru\\'afo\\'s neck with a syringe... DOUGHERTY Why haven\\'t you left orbit yet? RIKER Captain Picard is still on the surface, sir. DOUGHERTY Doing what? RIKER He didn\\'t want to leave until we could adequately explain why Data malfunctioned. His future in Starfleet could depend on it. Dougherty exchanges a concerned look with Ru\\'afo... DOUGHERTY Remind the captain his twelve hours are up. RIKER\\'S COM VOICE Yes, sir. DOUGHERTY Dougherty out. Ru\\'afo\\'s eyes are closed, as the green goo moves from his neck to the doctor\\'s syringe... SON\\'A DOCTOR Your body is producing far too many toxins... we\\'ve reached the limit of genetic manipulation... RU\\'AFO I won\\'t need any more genetic manipulation if our Federation friends will allow us to complete this mission. He opens his eyes, gives Dougherty a pointed look... 95 EXT. PLANET SURFACE - DAY - LOOKING DOWN TO SEE A SMALL 95 LAKE Picard, Data and the Ba\\'ku have moved toward a dam where Data is having trouble with is tricorder... DATA Tricorder functions are limited due to heavy deposits of kelbonite in these hills... PICARD How about a passive radiation scan? Data adjusts his tricorder... reacts... DATA Curious, there appear to be strong neutrino emissions coming from the lake... Staying with Data s he follows the tricorder to the edge of the lake... a brief pause... and then in a Harold Lloyd sort of moment, he steps into the lake up to his ankles, pauses again to look at the tricorder and then disappears under water. 96 ARTIM 96 reacts, astounded... looks to Picard... ARTIM Can he breathe under water? PICARD Data doesn\\'t breathe. ARTIM Won\\'t he rust? PICARD (smiles to himself) No. The boy turns his wide eyes back toward the lake. 97 UNDERWATER - DATA (OPTICAL) 97 An eel and a fish investigate him as he stands on the lake bottom, examining his tricorder... 98 EXT. LAKE - DAY 98 Data emerges at a distance from the others... calling -- DATA Sir, I believe I know what is causing the neutrino emissions... He climbs to the top of the earthen dam and turns a heavy wheel that might usually require the strength of two men, opening a floodgate... as he does -- ARTIM (fascinated) Are there other machines like him in the offland? SOJEF The offland is no concern of yours. 98A ANGLE WITH DATA 98A The water continues to run off and as we push to the falling water... 98B WITH PICARD 98B reacting as he looks down at the lake... 99 ANGLE (OPTICAL) 99 a strange displacement of water appearing as the lake drains... something invisible is sitting in the water... a bird lands on top of it... and as the water sinks lower, spilling off the sides of the invisible object, the shape is revealed to be that of a cloaked spaceship. 100 PICARD 100 PICARD A ship, DATA It is clearly Federation in origin, Captain. PICARD (quoting Dougherty) \\'Just a few loose ends to tie up.\\' As they move to a rowboat... Artim begins to follow but Sojef puts a firm arm on his shoulder. SOJEF We\\'re not interested in such things. Anij looks to Sojef... ANIJ I am. And she hops onto the rowboat with Picard and Data... decidedly not trusting either of them to go alone... PICARD It might be wiser for you to stay on shore. Anij\\'s answer is to grab an oar and push them away from shore... as Data and Picard exchange a glance, Picard takes the oar from her and... 101 WIDE - (OPTICAL) 101 Picard, Anij and Data row closer to the invisible ship. 102 CLOSER - THE ROWBOAT 102 Data presses controls on his tricorder. A hatch opens. Picard and Data draw phasers... 103 INT. HOLOGRAPHIC SHIP/VILLAGE - (OPTICAL) 103 As they climb in to find themselves in an identical image of the Ba\\'ku village. Anij is stunned... DATA (off tricorder) It is a holographic projection. Moving to a gap that shows the metal holo-grid... DATA (CONT\\'D) Incomplete, I might add. PICARD (to Anij) What you\\'re seeing is a computer driven image created by photons and forcefields... ANIJ I know what a hologram is, Captain. The question is -- why would someone want to create one of our village? PICARD (beat, considering) Data, if you were following the boy and discovered this ship... DATA ... it is conceivable I was shot to protect the secret of its existence. PICARD (beat, musing aloud) What possible purpose could a duplicate village have except... to deceive the Ba\\'ku... ANIJ Deceive us? PICARD To move you off this planet. You go to sleep one night in your village... wake up the next morning in this flying holodeck transported en masse. A week later, maybe a month, you\\'ve been relocated on a similar planet without ever realizing it. DATA Why would the Federation or the Son\\'a wish to move the Ba\\'ku? PICARD I don\\'t know. We may notice a look in Anij\\'s eyes - she knows why but doesn\\'t intend to say. Picard and Data don\\'t notice her reaction... 104 ANGLE - (OPTICAL) 104 Suddenly wham! -- a plasma charge is fired from the shadows of the \"village\" hologram... and then another and another... the shots hit walls revealing portions of the holo-grid (an effect we will see again later during the final action). Plasma ricochets off the walls spraying sparks over them all... as Data fires back, Picard grabs Anij and shoves her out of the hatch for her safety... 105 ANGLE OUT THE HATCH 105 as she falls several yards into the water making a big splash... Picard turns back and starts firing... 106 INT. HOLO-SHIP - (OPTICAL) 106 A brief, intense exchange of shots... creating more gaps in the holo-image... and finally a Son\\'a officer falls off the roof of a holo-building, unconscious. PICARD Computer, end program and decloak the vessel. And as the holo-image DEMATERIALIZES, they\\'re standing on a holodeck. 107 EXT. HOLO-SHIP - (OPTICAL) 107 DECLOAKING... Anij splaying her arms to keep afloat in the water... Picard and Data stick their heads out of the hatch... ANIJ I can\\'t swim! Data and Picard promptly jump in after her... PICARD (reaching for her) Don\\'t panic... ANIJ (with some humor) I\\'ve been shot at... thrown into the lake out of an invisible ship that\\'s come to abduct us all... what\\'s there to panic about? DATA In the event of a water landing, I have been designed to serve as a floatation device. He twists his neck a certain way and we hear a slight technical re-alignment and suddenly he floats...she hangs on as Picard swims over to retrieve the rowboat... 108 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - (OPTICAL) 108 Data and Picard MATERIALIZE... Worf, sporting a large red mark on his nose, observes. Picard is still wet and angry... on the move... PICARD Did any of the hostages mention a cloaked ship during their debriefings? WORF No, sir... PICARD Debrief them again. (noticing) Have you been in a fight, Commander? WORF (humiliated) No, sir. It is a gorch. PICARD Gorch? Data leans in and whispers the translation into Picard\\'s ear... Picard is embarrassed he brought it up... PICARD Oh... well, it\\'s hardly... noticeable... Off Data\\'s deadpan look at Picard, as they exit... 109 INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS 109 Riker with his clean shaven face moving to meet them... Picard and Data react... Riker smiles... RIKER Smooth as an android\\'s bottom, eh, Data? DATA I... beg your pardon, sir? For the rest of the sequence, Data observes Riker\\'s chin. Moving to the turbolift... RIKER Admiral Dougherty wants to know why we haven\\'t left yet... PICARD We\\'re not going anywhere. Worf and Riker exchange a glance as they enter... 110 INT. TURBOLIFT - CONTINUOUS 110 PICARD (CONT\\'D) Deck five. RIKER (re: the gorge) You Klingons never do anything small, do you... The doors close. Ignoring Riker -- WORF Doctor Crusher asked to talk to you when you returned... PICARD Picard to Crusher... 111 INT. SICKBAY 111 CRUSHER Captain, the Son\\'a hostages declined to be examined. I had them confined to quarters. PICARD\\'S COM VOICE And our people? CRUSHER They all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production... probably the result of the environmental anomalies here... PICARD\\'S COM VOICE Are they in any danger? CRUSHER Not at all. They\\'re fine... in fact, they\\'re better than fine. Increased metabolism, high energy, improved muscle tone. We should all be so lucky. PICARD\\'S COM VOICE Very good, Doctor. Picard out. 112 INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS 112 coming out of the turbolift toward Picard\\'s quarters... PICARD The Son\\'a officers are not to be released until I\\'ve met with Ahdar Ru\\'afo. He enters his quarters. Data finally submits to his curiosity and runs a finger along Riker\\'s chin... DATA No, sir. It is not. (off Riker\\'s look) As smooth as an android\\'s bottom. 113 INT. PICARD\\'S QUARTERS 113 As he enters... PICARD Computer, music. Picard\\'s favorite chamber music comes on... PICARD No. Not that. Something else. Something... Latin. COMPUTER VOICE Please specify. PICARD A mambo. (as the music comes on, his tension easing) That\\'s more like it... Picard moves to... 114 INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 114 He takes off his jacket and shirt... and begins to towel himself dry... as he glances in the mirror... his towel patting his face, slows to a stop as he stares at himself in the mirror... 115 CLOSE - THE HAIR AROUND HIS EAR 115 is changing color, no longer all white, it is now predominantly chestnut brown. 116 PICARD 116 looks, his mind adding up all the strange little things that have been happening on the ship... 117 EXT. ANIJ\\'S HOME - NIGHT 117 Picard knocks on a door... it is opened by Anij... PICARD How old are you? TIME CUT: 118 INT. ANIJ\\'S HOME - NIGHT 118 Austere but inviting with a warm fire... Sojef, Tournel and Artim have joined them... Artim spoons hot cider from a kettle into cups, serves it to the adults as the scene continues... SOJEF We came here from a solar system on the verge of self- annihilation... where technology had created weapons that threatened to destroy all life. A small group of us set off to find a new home... a home that would be isolated from the threats of other worlds. (beat) That was three hundred and nine years ago. PICARD (reacts) You\\'ve not aged a day since then? SOJEF Actually, I was a good deal older when we arrived... in terms of my physical condition. ANIJ There\\'s an unusual metaphasic radiation coming from the planet\\'s rings. It continuously regenerates the cells in our bodies. You must have noticed the effects by now. PICARD We\\'ve... just begun to. (to Artim) I suppose you\\'re seventy-five. ARTIM No. I\\'m twelve. TOURNEL The metaphasic radiation won\\'t begin to affect him until he reaches maturity... PICARD To many offlanders, what you have here would be more valuable than gold-pressed latinum. (beat) And I\\'m afraid it\\'s the reason that someone is trying to take this world away from you. ARTIM The artificial lifeform was right? PICARD If not for Data, you\\'d probably have been re-located by now. TOURNEL How can we possibly defend ourselves? SOJEF The moment we pick up a weapon, we become one of them... we lose everything we are... PICARD It may not come to that. They turn to him... PICARD Clearly, the architects of this conspiracy have tried to keep it a secret. Not just from you, but from my people as well. (beat) I don\\'t intend to let them. 119 EXT. VILLAGE - PREDAWN 119 ANIJ We\\'ve always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn\\'t been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... they\\'re attracted to stories of a faster pace of life... PICARD Most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down. ANIJ But not you. PICARD (smiles) There are days. ANIJ (beat, studying him) You don\\'t live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard. PICARD (self-effacing) In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me... ANIJ ... who wouldn\\'t be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don\\'t think so. PICARD You give me more credit than I deserve. Of course, I\\'m tempted. Who wouldn\\'t be? (beat) But some of the blackest marks in the history of my world have involved the forced relocation of a small group of people to satisfy the demands of a larger one. I\\'d like to believe we learn from our mistakes. Obviously, some of us haven\\'t. 120 NEW ANGLE - (OPTICAL) 120 Picard pausing to look in a corner window... beautifully hand-crafted quilts are displayed... PICARD The craftsmanship is extraordinary. ANIJ (smiles) This is a school... that\\'s a student\\'s work. (off his reaction) She\\'ll be ready to become an apprentice soon. Then, in thirty or forty years, she\\'ll take her place among the artisans... PICARD An apprentice for thirty years. (they continue walking) We\\'ve noticed your people\\'s mental discipline. Did that develop here? ANIJ (teasing) More questions. Always the explorer. If you stay long enough, that\\'ll change. PICARD Will it? ANIJ You\\'ll stop reviewing what happened yesterday... stop planning for tomorrow... until you find... (interrupting herself) Let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time? PICARD A perfect moment? ANIJ When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment... PICARD Seeing my home planet from space for the first time... ANIJ Yes. Exactly. Nothing more complicated than perception. (beat) You explore the universe. We\\'ve discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself... full of powerful forces... most people aren\\'t aware enough of the now... to ever notice them... PICARD I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn. ANIJ It took us centuries to learn that it doesn\\'t have to take centuries to learn. They reach a doorway to her home... PICARD There\\'s one thing I don\\'t understand. (off her look) In three hundred years...you never learned to swim? ANIJ (smiles) I just... haven\\'t gotten around to it yet. She steps forward to enter, pauses... ANIJ I wonder if you\\'re aware of the trust you endanger, Jean-Luc Picard. In my experience, it\\'s unusual for... PICARD ... an offlander? ANIJ (beat, smiles) For someone so young. Picard smiles, aware of a sexual tension... for the second time in his visit, a humming bird flitters by, briefly examining a street lamp and then away. She moves inside, glances back and smiles. Then she\\'s gone. Picard turns and looks at the horizon where the sun will come up soon... reacts as he sees -- 121 THE SILHOUETTE OF GEORDI LA FORGE - (OPTICAL) 121 standing there, looking out at the horizon... 122 CLOSER 122 as Picard moves over... PICARD Geordi...? Geordi turns and Picard reacts as he sees Geordi\\'s eyes... without the implants... Geordi smiles... LA FORGE Funniest thing, Captain. There wasn\\'t anything wrong with my implants. There was something right with my eyes. When Doctor Crusher removed the ocular connections, she found the cells around my optic nerves... PICARD ... had regenerated. LA FORGE It may not last after we leave. If not, I just wanted, before we go... (beat) I\\'ve never actually seen a sunrise. Picard considers him a long beat... and they turn to see -- 123 THE SUN - (OPTICAL) 123 cracking the horizon turning the lake red... 124 PICARD AND GEORDI 124 bathed in the sunlight... Picard\\'s face looking younger, contented in the new sun... 125 THE SUNRISE - VARIOUS SHOTS 125 ... the silhouette of an eagle-like bird coasting a foot above the water... the morning breeze brushing the red- tinged field of tall grass. 126 GEORDI 126 A tear rolls down his cheek... 127 WIDE - (OPTICAL) 127 as the sunlight cascades over the village and hills and if we weren\\'t sure this place was magic before, we certainly know it now. 128 EXT. SPACE - THE FOUR SON\\'A SHIPS - (OPTICAL) 128 dwarf the Enterprise as they move into orbit... 129 INT. READY ROOM (OPTICAL) 129 Dougherty and Ru\\'afo enter... Ru\\'afo is furious -- RU\\'AFO Am I to understand you\\'re not releasing my men, Captain? Picard at his desk working, looks up, makes strong eye contact with his guests... PICARD (quietly) I found the holoship. That stops Ru\\'afo. He looks at Dougherty who realizes some damage control will be necessary... DOUGHERTY Ru\\'afo, why don\\'t you let the Captain and I... Ru\\'afo\\'s face is so tight it seems it\\'s going to break... RU\\'AFO No! ... and it does -- a crack opens up from his forehead to his chin and blood dribbles out of it... RU\\'AFO (CONT\\'D) This entire mission has been one Federation blunder after another. You will return my men or this alliance will end with the destruction of your ship. He exits. Dougherty measures Picard for a beat... DOUGHERTY You\\'re looking well, Jean-Luc. Rested. PICARD Your \"Briar Patch\" turned out to be more hospitable than I expected. DOUGHERTY (nods) That\\'s why we put chromodynamic shields in place - so our people wouldn\\'t feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation... PICARD ... or understand that they were participating in the outright theft of a world. (beat) I won\\'t let you move them, Admiral. I\\'ll go to the Federation Council... DOUGHERTY I\\'m acting on orders form the Federation Council. PICARD (reacts, beat) How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive...? DOUGHERTY The Prime Directive doesn\\'t apply. These people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be immortal. We\\'ll simply be restoring their natural evolution. PICARD Who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people? DOUGHERTY There are six hundred people down there. We\\'ll be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to help billions. (beat) The Son\\'a have developed a procedure to collect the metaphasic particles form the planets rings... PICARD A planet in Federation space... DOUGHERTY Right. We have the planet and they have the technology -- a technology we can\\'t duplicate. You know what that makes us? Their partners. PICARD Our partners are nothing more than petty thugs. DOUGHERTY (dismissing that) On Earth, petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders. Warp drive transformed a bunch of Romulan thugs into an empire. We can handle the Son\\'a, I\\'m not worried about that... PICARD Someone probably said the same thing about the Romulans a century ago. DOUGHERTY With metaphasics, lifespans will be doubled... an entire new medical science will evolve... (beat) I understand your Chief Engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life... would you take his sight away from him? PICARD There are metaphasic particles all over The Briar Patch. Why must this planet be... DOUGHERTY (interrupting) The concentration in the rings is what makes the whole damned thing work. Don\\'t ask me to explain it. I only know they inject something into the rings that starts a thermolytic reaction. After it\\'s over, the planet will be unlivable for generations. PICARD Delay the procedure. Let my people look at the technology. DOUGHERTY Our best scientific minds already have. We can\\'t find any other way to do this. PICARD Then the Son\\'a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do... DOUGHERTY It would take ten years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition. Some of them won\\'t survive that long. Besides, they don\\'t want to live in the middle of The Briar Patch... who would? PICARD The Ba\\'ku. Picard and Dougherty look at each other a long beat. PICARD We are betraying the principles upon which the Federation was founded... this is an attack on the very soul of the Federation. (beat) This will destroy the Ba\\'ku. Just as cultures have been destroyed in every other forced relocation throughout history. DOUGHERTY We are only moving six hundred people, Jean-Luc. PICARD (beat) How many people would it take... before it becomes wrong? A thousand? Fifty thousand. A million? Dougherty has taken this as far as he intends to. DOUGHERTY I\\'m ordering you to the Goren system. File whatever protests you wish to. By the time you do, this will be all done. (moves to exit) I\\'m also ordering the release of the Son\\'a officers. He\\'s out. Picard sits at his desk for a long beat... 130 INT. BRIDGE 130 Worf at Conn, Data at Ops, Riker at command... they look up at Picard as he comes out of the Ready Room. PICARD Prepare the ship for departure at oh-seven-hundred hours. RIKER Aye, sir. Data exchanges a curious glance with Riker as Picard crosses to the turbolift. Before he gets in, he turns and looks at his bridge, imprinting it on his mind. 131 INT. PICARD\\'S QUARTERS 131 as he enters, stands in the middle of the room a long beat, his table still cluttered with charts and PADDS... 132 ANGLE - CLOSEUP - HIS DRESSER 132 One pip is placed on top, a second, third and fourth... 133 INT. SON\\'A BODY SCULPTURE CHAMBER - CLOSE ON A TOOTH 133 (OPTICAL) as it\\'s implanted into a very old man\\'s mouth and now, the old fellow has a mouthful of bright new teeth... Gallatin enters, moving to -- 134 RU\\'AFO - (OPTICAL) 134 sitting, his head locked in position by an apparatus... a female attendant actually giving him a facelift in front of our eyes... the device stretching his face ever tighter, as she snips off skin by one ear with a laser in a bloodless surgery that heals his wound... RU\\'AFO Gallatin! So the righteous Starfleet Captain finally released you. Did you encounter any problems on the surface? GALLATIN (acknowledges) No, sir. But it wasn\\'t easy... being among them... RU\\'AFO I\\'m sure. Just don\\'t forget what they did to us. (Gallatin nods) We\\'ll have them rounded up in a day or two... we needn\\'t bother with the Federation holo-ship any more. Just get the holding cells ready. Gallatin acknowledges, leaves. To the attendant - RU\\'AFO I\\'m going to miss these little flesh-stretching sessions of ours, my dear. As she pulls up his other ear... 135 INT. YACHT COCKPIT - (OPTICAL) 135 Picard, out of uniform, works a transporter and cases of military supplies MATERIALIZE on a loading platform that will lower into the cargo hold of the yacht... he studies a translucent geological scan of the surface that we will hear more about later... DATA (O.C.) Re-routing the transport grid to avoid detection was wise, sir, but the transporter is rarely used after oh-two-hundred hours. Picard turns to see Data, Troi, Crusher, La Forge, Worf and Riker have entered the hatch. All but Riker and Geordi are out of uniform. TROI Taking the Captain\\'s yacht out for a spin? WORF (examining the cargo) Seven metric tons of ultritium explosives, eight tetryon pulse launchers, ten isomagnetic disintegrators... RIKER You must be planning on doing some hunting. PICARD Go back to your quarters (no one moves) That\\'s an order. No one moves. RIKER No uniform? No orders. Geordi, with his normal eyes, moves forward... LA FORGE How could I look at another sunrise, knowing what my sight cost these people, Captain? Picard looks at them with appreciation. DATA I feel obliged to point out that the environmental anomalies may be stimulating certain rebellious instincts common to youth that could affect everyone\\'s judgment. Except mine, of course. CRUSHER Okay, Data, what do you think we should do? Data looks to everyone, considering a beat... picks up a phaser rifle... activates it... DATA Saddle up. Lock and load. The family united looks to their Captain for instructions. Picard looks to them with deep affection. PICARD They won\\'t begin the procedure while the planet is inhabited. So, our job is to keep the planet inhabited. He looks at Riker and La Forge, knowing that his first officer and chief engineer must stay with the ship. PICARD (CONT\\'D) Go back and put a face on what\\'s happening here. Make the Council see the Ba\\'ku. It\\'s too easy to turn a blind eye to the suffering of an unfamiliar people. Riker and La Forge acknowledge. Picard takes an extra moment to look, perhaps for the last time, into the eyes of his first officer with affection... PICARD There\\'s a short letter I left you all, just some... sentimental nonsense... the computer will bring it to your attention at oh- four-hundred... I\\'d just as soon you delete it... RIKER Fat chance. I\\'ll post it on every monitor on the ship... Picard grins with nice embarrassment, then with a serious look to Riker -- PICARD We\\'ll hold out as long as we can. Riker understands they\\'re counting on him. Picard hits a panel and the weapons sink into the yacht... as the non-uniformed officers move to take their posts, Riker takes Troi in his arms, kisses her good-bye. The others react in surprise. DATA Apparently the environmental anomalies are also stimulating... Worf shuts him up with a hard look... Data gets the message, sits in a cockpit chair and quietly begins to work... 136 EXT. SPACE - THE YACHT - (OPTICAL) 136 falls away from the belly of the mother ship... and after a beat, the thrusters ignite and off they go... 137 INT. SON\\'A SHIP TACTICAL ROOM - (OPTICAL) 137 Ru\\'afo watches a realistic simulation of a space procedure on a monitor... a small but sophisticated injector assembly sailing into the planet\\'s rings begins to fire charges that start a thermolytic reaction (we see only the early stages here)... Gallatin enters with a PADD... RU\\'AFO The injector performs perfectly in every simulation... GALLATIN Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit, one of their support craft went down to the surface. (Ru\\'afo reacts, takes the PADD) It appeared to be the Captain\\'s Yacht. Five persons on board. RU\\'AFO We\\'re not waiting until morning... take the shuttles and get everyone off the surface tonight. Gallatin starts to leave... pauses as -- RU\\'AFO Gallatin, if Picard or any of his people interfere... eliminate them. 138 EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT - (OPTICAL) 138 On a door opening... as we hear a bell ringing... the face of Artim fills the screen... his eyes scared... and as we reveal his point of view of the village, it\\'s a stunning sight -- Tournel pulling on the warning bell in the square... hundreds of people moving with urgency... supplies are being packed onto the backs of llamas... Worf, Data and Troi are unpacking the cases of military supplies that have already been loaded from the (unseen) yacht... Picard is going over charts with Anij and Sojef near-by... VARIOUS BA\\'KU (ad lib) What is it? What\\'s going on? What\\'s happened? Is something wrong? TOURNEL We\\'re leaving the village... take only what you need. Bring food... we may not be back for days... Artim jumps with a start as a slim, high-tech device on a stake suddenly lights up like a Christmas tree beside him... sees Data who just activated it... DATA It is a transport inhibitor. It will help prevent Son\\'a ships from beaming anyone off the surface... Artim, overwhelmed and still scared of the android, backs away from Data without responding and moves toward his father. Picard is showing Anij and Sojef the translucent geo-scans we saw on the yacht... PICARD ... these are the veins of kelbonite running through the hills... the more concentrated the deposits the more trouble they\\'ll have with their transporters... our route will keep us close to these deposits as possible... Artim moves beside his father, holds onto him... PICARD (CONT\\'D) When we\\'re forced away by the terrain, we\\'ll use transport inhibitors to compensate. The mountains have the highest concentrations. Once we\\'re there, transport will be virtually impossible... ANIJ There are caves in those mountains. PICARD (acknowledges) We can hold them off a long time... once we get there... (beat) But they will not make it easy to get there... Worf and Data move over... DATA Captain, I\\'ve activated transport inhibitors around the village... PICARD Good. Let\\'s begin to move these people out... WORF Should I distribute phasers to the Ba\\'ku, sir...? PICARD No. We\\'ll be responsible for that, Mister Worf. They all react to the sound of thrusters flying overhead... they look up to see -- 139 P.O.V. - THE NIGHT SKY - (OPTICAL) 139 as Son\\'a shuttlecraft roar overhead... 140 INT. SON\\'A SHUTTLE - NIGHT 140 SON\\'A OFFICER #1 Transporters are not functioning. GALLATIN (off sensors) They\\'re blocking the beams with some kind of inhibitors. We\\'ll have to locate and destroy them. 141 EXT. FIELD - WIDE NIGHT - (OPTICAL) 141 The mass of people cross the fields.. the Starfleet officers separated at intervals among them, continuing to encourage and assist them forward... progress slows as they converge onto the narrow path leading into the hills... 142 ANGLE NEAR THE VILLAGE - (OPTICAL) 142 with Sojef and Artim... SOJEF Don\\'t try to carry too much... we\\'ve got a long climb ahead of us... Suddenly, the ground shakes with booms as the ships overhead fire a series of air to surface missiles parallel to the path ahead... voices raise in fear, parents grab their children, people begin to move more quickly, some drop what they\\'re carrying... 143 OMITTED 143 & & 144 144 145 ANOTHER SON\\'A SHIP - (OPTICAL) 145 fires at the surface... we see the blast knock out... 146 A TRANSPORT INHIBITOR 146 that explodes...near-by -- 147 WORF 147 reacts...moves to Picard and Anij guiding people up the narrow path as the explosions continue... WORF We\\'ve lost an inhibitor! There\\'s a gap in the field... 148 EXT. FIELD - WIDE (OPTICAL) 148 As another wave of ships passes over, suddenly, with the moving sounds of ships above, people caught in the unprotected gap are swept away on a path of DEMATERIALIZATION...maybe fifty are just scooped away from the crowd... and now people are really panicking, screaming, cries, pushing forward... some scatter... 149 ARTIM - (OPTICAL) 149 being pushed, trying to hang onto his father... but as the ships continue to pass over and the DEMATERIALIZATIONS in the same gap continue, suddenly Sojef is beamed away... ARTIM My father! His voice is lost in the cries of the scared people who surge even harder forward toward the protection of the next inhibitor and now the boy is thrust to the ground. As he falls, the little palm-pet slips out of his pocket... Artim desperately tries to save him from being stepped on, finally snatches him in his hand. But now the crush of people threatens to trample the boy and it\\'s a reminder how scary it can be to be small. Suddenly, an arm reaches down and scoops him up... and as we follow Artim up, we can see it\\'s Data who has rescued him... their eyes connect briefly as Data carries him forward... in the pushing crowd... 150 ANGLE - PICARD - (OPTICAL) 150 PICARD Stay in the protected areas... we\\'ll be safe when we get into the hills... The people file ahead up the path... 151 INT. SON\\'S TACTICAL ROOM 151 Dougherty, Gallatin and Ru\\'afo study black and white aerial surveillance photographs of the Ba\\'ku exodus up the foothills. Dougherty is angry and embarrassed... GALLATIN They\\'re following the kelbonite deposits... using the interference to block our transporters... RU\\'AFO Recommendations? DOUGHERTY Take me down. Let me talk to Picard. RU\\'AFO Talk... we should send down an assault team and take them by force. DOUGHERTY That is not an acceptable option. If people get hurt, all the support we have in the Federation... RU\\'AFO Federation support, Federation procedures, Federation rules... look in the mirror, Admiral... the Federation is old... in the last twenty four months, it\\'s been challenged by every major power in the quadrant -- the Borg, the Cardassians, the Dominion... they all smell the scent of death on the Federation. That\\'s why you\\'ve embraced our offer... because it will give your dear Federation new life. Well, how badly do you want it, Admiral? Because there are hard choices to be made now. If the Enterprise gets through with news about their brave Captain\\'s valiant struggle on behalf of the defenseless Ba\\'ku, your Federation politicians will waver, your Federation opinion polls will open a public debate, your Federation allies will want their say... need I go on? Dougherty takes a deep breath... knows Ru\\'afo is right. Gallatin hates the idea of a violent assault, gives Dougherty the other option he\\'s desperately seeking -- GALLATIN There is an alternative to an all- out assault. Isolinear tags would allow our transporters to lock on to them. RU\\'AFO We\\'d have to tag every one of them... that would take time... and we don\\'t have it. The Enterprise is only nineteen hours from communications range with the Federation... DOUGHERTY I\\'ll order Riker to turn around. RU\\'AFO Picard\\'s first officer. Do you really believe he\\'ll listen? Ru\\'afo\\'s clearly lost faith in the Admiral\\'s ability to control the situation... Dougherty\\'s jaw tightens... RU\\'AFO My ships are capable of intercepting the Enterprise before it reaches the perimeter. I could send them to... escort... it back... but Commander Riker might not want to come... And we slowly push into Dougherty as he steps across his self-imposed moral line... DOUGHERTY Send your ships. Dougherty tries to digest the knot in his stomach... 152 EXT. PLANET SURFACE - DAWN (MATTE/OPTICAL) 152 Deep into the foothills now... much steeper terrain... feeling the power of the mountains near-by... seeing the path below as hundreds of Ba\\'ku and dozens of llamas wind their way up... it\\'s almost biblical in scope with Picard and Moses leading the way... 153 ANGLE WITH DATA AND ARTIM - (OPTICAL) 153 They\\'ve been walking silently for some time...Artim struggling inside to reconcile what he\\'s been taught about machines and the experience he\\'s had with Data... ARTIM My father told me I shouldn\\'t talk to you. DATA I understand. ARTIM I don\\'t. They exchange a glance. Artim sighs, troubled. ARTIM Not everyone here agrees with him. I mean, you know, about machines. There was even a big fight about it once. (beat) Do you like being a machine? DATA (considering) I aspire to be more than I am. ARTIM I know why. (off Data\\'s look) So people like us won\\'t be afraid of you any more. DATA (a beat) Perhaps, that is true. The boy is obviously tired from miles of walking uphill... ARTIM Don\\'t you ever get tired? DATA My power cells continually re- charge themselves. ARTIM I can\\'t imagine what it would be like to be a machine. Data studies him... (and it should be noted that his responses are a deliberate attempt to enlighten Artim, give the child a new perspective on what it means to be an android.) DATA Perhaps it would surprise you to know that I have often tried to imagine what it would be like to be a child... ARTIM Really? DATA Really. ARTIM (with fatigue) For one thing, your legs are shorter than everyone else\\'s. DATA But they are in a constant state of growth. Do you find it difficult to adapt? (off Artim\\'s perplexed look) A child\\'s specifications are never the same from one moment to the next. I am surprised that you do not... trip over your own feet. ARTIM Sometimes I do. DATA My legs are eighty-seven-point- two centimeters. They were eighty-seven-point-two centimeters the day I was created. They will be eighty- seven-point-two centimeters the day I go off line. My operation depends on specifications that do not change. (beat) I... cannot imagine... the experience of growing up or even tripping over my own feet... Artim is seeing the artificial lifeform in a whole new light now, which is exactly what Data intended... ARTIM But you\\'ve never had adults telling you what to do all the time... or bedtimes... or having to eat food you don\\'t like... DATA I would gladly accept the requirement of a bedtime in exchange for knowing what it is like to be a child. ARTIM (considering) Do machines ever play? DATA I play the violin... and my chess routines are quite advanced... ARTIM No, I mean... He tries to find a way to explain, gets an idea -- pokes him with a finger... ARTIM You\\'re it. And he starts to run away... DATA I\\'m what? Artim frowns, stops... ARTIM Chase me! DATA For what purpose? ARTIM Because you\\'re it. And if you tag me... then I\\'m it. DATA But I can run much faster than you... I am capable of exceeding forty-seven meters per second... ARTIM (sighs, walking back) Data... haven\\'t you ever just played... for fun? DATA Androids... don\\'t have...fun. ARTIM Why not...? DATA (beat) No one\\'s ever asked me that before. ARTIM If you want to know \\'what it\\'s like to be a child\\', you need to learn how to play... As Data considers... 154 WITH PICARD AND ANIJ 154 at point... walking up a part of the trail protected by towering rocks. Worf approaches from the rear... (Note: we may notice more physical changes in our people because of the regenerative process. For example, Picard\\'s hair is darker and there actually seems to be a touch more of it growing than before... Worf\\'s hair is more straggly, unkempt...) PICARD (not serious) You need a haircut, Commander. WORF Accelerated hair growth is often experienced by Klingons during Jak\\'tahla... ANIJ Jak\\'tahla? PICARD Roughly translated: puberty... although for a Klingon that\\'s not doing it justice... (to Worf) Any severe mood swings, unusual aggressive tendencies -- be sure to let me know right away... WORF The Ba\\'ku could use some rest, sir. According to the geo-scan, this may be the safest area for the next few kilometers... PICARD Very well. We\\'ll take an hour. Break out some rations... Worf acknowledges, signals and the column lumbers to a halt... people sit along the trail... 155 AROUND THE BEND - (OPTICAL/MATTE) 155 A spectacular view of the mountains ahead... Picard and Anij move forward through some brush, lay on their stomachs as Picard uses 24th century field glasses to examine the path ahead... ANIJ Right beyond that ridge is where the caves begin... we can hide for days... PICARD By now the Son\\'a have scanned the area and know that just as well as we do. She studies him as he continues to survey the territory they must still cross... on a whim, she reaches out and runs a finger across his bald head... he looks up, surprised... ANIJ (smiles) It\\'s been three hundred years since I\\'ve seen a bald man. He grins, studies her... they feel the sexual tension... after a beat... PICARD How is it a woman like you never married? And don\\'t tell me you \"just haven\\'t gotten around to it yet\"... ANIJ What\\'s the rush? PICARD (beat) I should warn you... I\\'ve always been attracted to older women... She looks seriously at him, takes his hand in hers, guides both hands to touch his cheek. 156 PICARD\\'S SUBJECTIVE POV - (OPTICAL) 156 ... and in that moment, his perception and our view begin to move down her arm... and we enter... 157 AN ALTERED REALITY - (OPTICAL) 157 Picard, and we, find ourselves in a heightened state of sensory perception -- time seems to be slowing down to a crawl, sounds are sharper... we hear Picard\\'s heart beating slowly with a booming percussion... he follows her gaze to see yet another humming bird, hears its languid wing motion... swirling dust from the mountain seems like a zipping scarf in a breeze that plays in his ears like a natural flute... his breath becomes more even as he relaxes into this altered state and he feels... 158 HER FINGERS 158 gently touching the hair at the top of his chest, sensing, even hearing, her fingertips against his flesh. 159 HER LIPS 159 brush his cheek, his lips... her teeth nip gently on his lower lip, tugging it and then her lips press against his for an eternity... 160 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE - (OPTICAL) 160 Moving at one-third impulse through The Briar Patch... 161 INT.

RIKER How long \\'til they reach us? PERIM Eighteen minutes... LA FORGE We\\'re not going to be able to get a transmission out of here for at least another hour... NARA They\\'re hailing us. RIKER Tell them our transceiver assembly is down, that we can send messages but can\\'t receive them. Nara sends the message... a beat... NARA I don\\'t think they believe us. RIKER Why not? Boom... a small explosion well off target... the ship shakes gently... RIKER (off sensors) A photon torpedo. (dry) Isn\\'t that the universal greeting when communications are down? LA FORGE I think it\\'s the universal greeting when you don\\'t like someone. Another boom shakes them slightly... RIKER Full impulse. LA FORGE The manifold can\\'t handle full impulse in the Patch, Commander. RIKER If we don\\'t outrun them, the manifolds are going to be the only thing left of this ship. LA FORGE (nods) I\\'ll be in Engineering. La Forge exits. A supernumerary quickly replaces him. RIKER All hands. Battle stations! 162 EXT. TRAIL - DAY 162 TROI And have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up? CRUSHER (dry) Not that we care about such things in this day and age. TROI Uh huh. Data glances at their breasts as he hands them plates... CRUSHER Thank you, Data. We stay with him as he takes the tray to Worf who looks at the plate with disdain... WORF I have an odd craving for the blood of a live Kolar beast. (off Data\\'s look) The environment must be affecting me again. DATA (agreeing) And have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up? (Worf reacts) Not that we care about such things in this day and age. Suddenly, the distant sound of approaching thrusters... 163 ANGLE - FOUR SON\\'A SHUTTLES (OPTICAL) 163 coming over the horizon...

WORF Definitely feeling aggressive tendencies... 184 ANGLE WITH DATA AND ARTIM - (OPTICAL) 184 surrounded by Ba\\'ku as they move quickly along a very steep trail, Data firing at drones as they go... suddenly just in front of them, a Son\\'a assault team appears over the ridge... three armed foot soldiers ready to take prisoners...

LA FORGE Detonating the warp core might neutralize the cascade... but then again it might not. Subspace weapons are unpredictable. That\\'s why they were banned. NARA The tear is closing on us... impact in fifteen seconds... RIKER Eject the core. LA FORGE I just did. NARA Impact in ten seconds... RIKER Detonate! 194 INT.

Data moves to Picard from the interior of the cave... PICARD (to Data) How many? DATA Another forty-three people reported taken, sir... Picard frowns, sighs, takes in their new surroundings... suddenly, the caverns are shaken by the sound of overhead explosions... reactions, fearful murmurs, skittish llamas... 202 ON ARTIM 202 sitting with other Ba\\'ku... they look up at the frightening sound... sand drifting dangerously from the ceiling... 203 CLOSE ON ARTIM\\'S POCKET 203 The palm-pet crawls out... 204 EXT.

Her eyes react as she sees something else on the tricorder... this is impossible, she checks again. CRUSHER Captain... Picard moves over cautiously... PICARD Will he live? CRUSHER Yes. But look at this medscan... He looks at the tricorder, reacts incredulously... PICARD How could this be possible? She shakes her head, looks back to the cavern entrance where Anij and Tournel are assisting the last Ba\\'ku out of the cave... CRUSHER Maybe we should ask them. Data and Troi return to lead the last group out of the cave... 220 HYDOTHERMAL CAVERN 220 Artim is among a dozen of so of the Ba\\'ku waiting to be taken...he reaches into his pocket for his palm-pet, can\\'t find it... he reacts... he moves into the main cavern away from the others... a beat later, Anij and Tournel ready the group...

Picard looks to see if he still has his tricorder; he does... he trains it on her... the reading are not good... PICARD Help is coming. She looks at him and tries to smile, but it\\'s too much... and her eyes close... and the tricorder tells Picard she\\'s on the edge of death... PICARD Worf, you must hurry...

Crusher crawls in and uses the hypospray an Anij\\'s neck... measures her lifesigns with the tricorder, smiles at Picard... CRUSHER She\\'s stabilizing. PICARD Is it safe to move her?

A beat as he locks eyes with Dougherty. DOUGHERTY Order them to surrender, and I promise you won\\'t be court- martialed. PICARD If a court-martial is the only way to tell the people of the Federation what happened here, then I welcome it. Ru\\'afo enters, controlled rage, hands a PADD to Dougherty. RU\\'AFO The Enterprise has destroyed one of my ships. The other is on fire, requesting assistance. A beat. Picard reacts as Dougherty studies the PADD. PICARD (to Dougherty) The Enterprise would only fire if it were defending itself. Ru\\'afo must have ordered the attack. (beat) I can\\'t believe he would\\'ve given that order without your consent, Admiral. Dougherty maintains eye contact but has completely lost his dignity... PICARD I wonder... which one of us will be facing that court-martial... DOUGHERTY (to Ru\\'afo) There\\'s nothing further to be gained from this... RU\\'AFO You\\'re right. This is going to end now. (to Picard) The Ba\\'ku want to stay on the planet. Let them. I\\'m going to launch the injector... Gallatin\\'s face reacts to that...Picard sees his sharp displeasure and then for an instant their eyes meet. Gallatin looks away, but Picard registers the information. DOUGHERTY You\\'re not going to launch anything until... RU\\'AFO In six hours, every living thing in this system will be dead or dying. He starts to exit... PICARD You would kill your own people, Ru\\'afo? Your own parents, your brothers, sisters... (off Dougherty\\'s look) Didn\\'t you know, Admiral? The Ba\\'ku and the Son\\'a are the same race. Dougherty, confused, looks to Ru\\'afo... who doesn\\'t look back... Sojef stands and comes forward... to Ru\\'afo -- SOJEF Which one were you? Gal\\'na... Ro\\'tin...Belath\\'nin... I\\'m sorry, I don\\'t recognize you... RU\\'AFO Those names, those children are gone forever. DOUGHERTY What is he talking about? SOJEF A century ago, a group of our young people wanted to follow the ways of the offlanders. They tried to take over the colony... and when they failed... RU\\'AFO When we failed, you exiled us. To die slowly. Anij gathers the strength to look at him... ANIJ You\\'re Ro\\'tin, aren\\'t you...? There\\'s something in the voice. (to Gallatin) Would you be his friend Gal\\'na? (Gallatin looks away) I helped your mother bathe you when you were a child. She still speaks of you. PICARD (to Dougherty) You\\'ve brought the Federation into the middle of a blood feud, Admiral. The children have returned to expel their elders... just as they were once expelled. Except Ru\\'afo\\'s need for revenge has now escalated to parricide. Ru\\'afo exits. Gallatin looks at Sojef and then follows. Dougherty is a lost man, realizing his tragic errors. DOUGHERTY It was for the Federation. It was all for the Federation. Picard offers no sympathy... Dougherty turns and exits... 244 INT.

Ru\\'afo moves away from the device and grabs Dougherty roughly... moving him across the room... RU\\'AFO I do not take orders from you. DOUGHERTY If you begin the procedure while the planet is still populated, the Federation will pursue you until... Ru\\'afo, more powerful than Dougherty, throws him down into one of the treatment chairs... RU\\'AFO The Federation... He locks Dougherty\\'s head into the device... switches several panels... the device lights up ominously... RU\\'AFO (CONT\\'D) ... will never know what happened here. He hits a switch and begins to raise Dougherty\\'s ears in the facelift procedure we saw before... Dougherty struggles but Ru\\'afo holds him down... as the Admiral\\'s twists and morphs into a grotesque facelift that finally strangles him to death. 245 INT. SON\\'A BRIDGE 245 Ru\\'afo enters...Gallatin and officers on duty... RU\\'AFO Admiral Dougherty will not be joining us for diner. Deploy the collector. (Gallatin hesitates) Do you have a problem with those orders? GALLATIN May I talk to you alone? RU\\'AFO (to another officer) Deploy the collector. The officer complies. GALLATIN Moving them is one thing. Killing them all... RU\\'AFO No one hated them more than you, Gal\\'na. (beat, intimately) We\\'ve come a long way together. This is the moment we\\'ve planned for so many years... Gallatin looks at his friend, his commander... Ru\\'afo pats him encouragingly on the shoulder... RU\\'AFO Separate the Starfleet personnel and secure them in the aft cargo hold... see that Picard joins them... GALLATIN The shields in that section won\\'t protect them against the thermolytic reaction... RU\\'AFO Thank-you for reminding me. He sits in his command seat and watches his viewscreen... 246 ANGLE INCLUDE SCREEN - THE SON\\'A SCIENCE VESSEL - 246 (OPTICAL) as huge hatches open and the particle collector that will capture the metaphasic radiation from the rings slowly extends out in both directions. After a beat, Gallatin exits... push in to Ru\\'afo... 247 INT. COLLECTOR - (OPTICAL) 247 an Astrodome-sized chamber full of weird crisscrossing patterns of pipes, conduits, cables, and rails -- all of them stretching slowing outward as the collector expands. 248 EXT. SPACE - BRILLIANT SOLAR SAILS 248 begin to unfurl majestically in front of the planet\\'s rings... and now we recognize it as the remarkable device we saw earlier in Ru\\'afo\\'s simulation. 249 INT. SON\\'A BRIG - (OPTICAL) 249 Picard has climbed the rear wall with help from two Ba\\'ku, examines the forcefield generators in the ceiling. ANIJ (a warning) Jean-Luc... Gallatin arrives... armed with a hand weapon. Aiming it at Picard, he turns off the forcefield... GALLATIN Come with me. Picard measures him for a moment then comes out, smiles \\'don\\'t worry\\' to Anij... Gallatin restores the field and motions for Picard to exit... 250 INT. SON\\'A CORRIDOR 250 walking to a turbolift... unusually cordial considering the circumstances -- PICARD It must have been very strange for you. (off his look) When you were a hostage. Being among the friends and families you knew so many years ago. All of them looking exactly as they did. Almost like... looking through the eyes of childhood again. Gallatin presses a panel at the lift... Picard fixes his eyes on him, evenly -- PICARD And here you are trying to close those eyes again... to pretend you can\\'t see what the bitterness has done to your people... what it\\'s done to Ru\\'afo... and to you (beat) It\\'s turned you... into a coward. (off his reaction) A man who ignores his conscience. The turbolift arrives... GALLATIN Get in. Picard enters... 251 INT. TURBOLIFT - CONTINUOUS 251 PICARD A coward... without the moral courage to stop an unspeakable atrocity. You offend me. GALLATIN (incredulous) Is this how a Federation officer begs for his life? PICARD I\\'m not begging for my life. I\\'m begging for yours. (beat) There is still a way home, Gal\\'na. Gallatin looks at Picard a long, miserable beat, then... GALLATIN Computer, close turbolift doors. The doors close. Gallatin lowers his weapon. GALLATIN What you\\'re asking me to do... is impossible... the crew is loyal to Ru\\'afo... PICARD Do you know how to disable the injector? GALLATIN (nods) But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge. PICARD If we could lure him away from the bridge... GALLATIN (shaking his head) It doesn\\'t matter where he is. As soon as he realizes something is happening, he\\'ll override my commands with one word at his com- link... PICARD (beat, an idea) What if he doesn\\'t realize something\\'s happening... (Gallatin reacts, confused) Can you get me to a transmitter? I have to speak with Worf and Data on the surface... we\\'ll need their help... As Gallatin acknowledges, still uncertain what Picard\\'s up to... GALLATIN Deck twelve. 252 EXT. SPACE - THE COLLECTOR - (OPTICAL) 252 sails fully extended now... 253 INT. SON\\'A BRIDGE - (OPTICAL) 253 RU\\'AFO Initiate launch sequence. SON\\'A OFFICER #2 Activating injector assembly. SON\\'A OFFICER #3 Launch in (TECH) minutes. Establish a digital display near Ru\\'afo\\'s command post that shows (time TECH) counting down. Ru\\'afo is calm, determined. Suddenly a tiny boom. Reactions. SON\\'A OFFICER #3 A small craft is coming up from the surface. It\\'s firing tachyon bursts at us... RU\\'AFO On screen. On the screen, the Captain\\'s yacht approaches, firing... SON\\'A OFFICER #3 One person aboard. It\\'s the android. Ru\\'afo dismisses the puny attack... RU\\'AFO He\\'s no threat. 254 EXT. SPACE - THE YACHT - (OPTICAL) 254 firing at the Son\\'a ship... the solar collector continuing to power up in the background... 255 INT. YACHT COCKPIT 255 Data is alone... presses the companel... DATA Data to Picard... PICARD\\'S COM VOICE Yes, Data... 256 INT. SON\\'A SHIP ELECTRICAL CONDUIT - PICARD 256 crawling through the narrow passage behind Gallatin... DATA\\'S COM VOICE Sir, they\\'re ignoring my attack. PICARD Keep firing tachyon bursts into their shield grid. Is Worf in position...? 257 INT. YACHT - (OPTICAL) 257 DATA Yes, sir. He\\'s ready for simultaneous transport. PICARD\\'S COM VOICE We\\'ll be at the bridge in two minutes... Picard out... Data moves the ship into an attack posture, diving at the larger vessel seen in the window... firing... 258 OMITTED 258 259 INT. SON\\'A BRIDGE - (OPTICAL) 259 The collector on the viewscreen... SON\\'A OFFICER #3 Detonation in three minutes. SON\\'A OFFICER #2 Sir, the Federation ship is creating a disruption in our shields... if they go out of phase, it will increase our exposure to the thermolytic reaction... RU\\'AFO (beat, irritated) Very well. Destroy that ship and reset our shield harmonics... do not delay the countdown... 260 EXT. SPACE - THE YACHT - (OPTICAL) 260 is hit by a concentrated burst of fire from the Son\\'a ship... it goes spinning out of control... 261 INT. YACHT 261 Data tries to control the yacht. He\\'s hit again... his whole console is smoking... DATA (off console) Data to Picard. They are rotating the shield harmonics. I am attempting to return to the surface... 262 INT. SON\\'A BRIDGE - (OPTICAL) 262 SON\\'A OFFICER #3 The Federation ship has been disabled. SON\\'A OFFICER #2 Launch in thirty seconds. Suddenly, there is an extended optical flash (note: long enough to cover a brief transporter effect). Reactions. RU\\'AFO What is that? SON\\'A OFFICER #3 I don\\'t know. (the effect ends) Systems don\\'t seem affected... SON\\'A OFFICER #2 Launch in fifteen seconds. See the digital countdown display at 00:15. 263 ANGLE TO INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN - (OPTICAL) 263 to see the collector with its sails fully extended... SON\\'A OFFICER #2 Ten seconds. A tiny section of the collector is launched toward the rings... SON\\'A OFFICER #2 Injector assembly launched. As it enters, it begins to disperse charges that set off a chain reaction in the ring system... the very nature of the rings changes before our eyes, and flumes of particulate matter scatter away. The process continues racing along the rings... all of this is seen on the viewscreen... 264 CLOSE ON RU\\'AFO 264 He watches mesmerized, his vengeance finally satisfied. RU\\'AFO Exactly as the simulations predicted... SON\\'A OFFICER #2 Sir, I am not showing any change in metaphasic flux levels... 265 WIDER - (OPTICAL) 265 RU\\'AFO Your scanners must be malfunctioning. SON\\'A OFFICER #2 (off console, puzzled) All ship functions are off-line. Ru\\'afo reacts, turns to a station and presses panels... RU\\'AFO How can there be no ship functions if the viewscreen is working, artificial gravity is stable, life support is... But his eyes catch something. He moves across the bridge to a small visual gap where a holo-grid is visible... his eyes react with horror... he reaches out, touches it... RU\\'AFO A holodeck? He takes out a disruptor and fires it at the wall revealing a further portion of the holo-grid in the same effect we saw earlier with Picard and Data... RU\\'AFO A holodeck? He fires again and again...revealing more of the grid... his repeated blasting eventually reveals a short flight of stairs... he leads the way up them... 266 INT. HOLO-SHIP BRIDGE - (OPTICAL) 266 Barely more than a cockpit with a large window into space -- as they enter, Ru\\'afo reacts as he sees the rings are normal... his own ship is right there in front of him... RU\\'AFO (stunned, realizing) We were transported to the holo- ship when we reset our shields. Everything we saw... was an illusion. (hitting his com-link) Ru\\'afo, authorization delta two- one... override all interlink commands to injector assembly one. He stands there, but his com-link responds simply... SON\\'A COMPUTER Unable to comply. Injector assembly one has been de- activated. On his reaction... 267 INT. SON\\'A BRIDGE - (OPTICAL) 267 where Picard, Worf and Gallatin are firmly in command... see the real countdown display has been frozen at 2:12. WORF All injector sub-systems are confirmed off-line. PICARD Decloak the holo-ship and engage a tractor beam, Mister Worf. As Worf presses panels and the holo-ship DECLOAKS on the viewscreen, Picard presses a companel... PICARD Picard to Data. 268 INT. YACHT COCKPIT - (OPTICAL) 268 as the ship re-enters the planet\\'s atmosphere, shaking badly, heating up... a piece of the roof breaks off... PICARD\\'S COM VOICE Your status? DATA Precarious, sir... I am having trouble re-entering the atmosphere... I believe I will have to transport to the surface... Data is heating up and turning red just as the rest of the ship is. PICARD\\'S COM VOICE Understood. Well done. DATA Thank-you, sir. He DEMATERIALIZES. A beat later, the yacht disintegrates in the atmosphere. 269 INT. HOLO-SHIP COCKPIT 269 Ru\\'afo is frustrated... RU\\'AFO This ship is equipped with fourteen long range transporters... are they all useless...? SON\\'A OFFICER #2 (working the console) They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here. RU\\'AFO Isolate one and re-route its command sequence through the auxiliary processor... SON\\'A OFFICER #3 Sir, there\\'s nothing we can do... they already have control of our ship. RU\\'AFO I don\\'t plan on going back to our ship. 270 EXT. SPACE - BRIAR PATCH - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL) 270 on it\\'s way back... 271 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 271 Riker at Command, La Forge at Ops, Perim at Conn, Nara at Tactical. Basic repairs have been done, but the bridge still shows signs of the battle. NARA Sir, we\\'re within sensor range of the Son\\'a ship. I\\'m picking up Captain Picard\\'s com-signal on board... Off Riker\\'s reaction... 272 INT. SON\\'A BRIDGE 272 RIKER\\'S COM VOICE Enterprise to Picard... PICARD (reacts) Number one. RIKER\\'S COM VOICE We should be at your position in seven minutes. Do you need assistance... PICARD Negative. Did you succeed? 273 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 273 RIKER The Council has ordered a halt to the Ba\\'ku relocation while they conduct a top-level review. 274 INT. SON\\'A BRIDGE 274 PICARD Top level review, my ass. There\\'ll be no cover-up of this. Not after I get... WORF Captain... He motions to the digital display... counting backwards at 2:05 now... Picard reacts... Gallatin works the controls... GALLATIN The countdown control has been transferred to the collector...I can\\'t override... PICARD Scan for lifesigns. WORF One. It\\'s Ru\\'afo. PICARD Can you beam him off? WORF Negative. He\\'s established a security field around the control room... PICARD Is there any other way to disable the injector? Gallatin thinks, then calls up... 275 ANGLE (OPTICAL) - COMPUTER DISPLAY SHOWING THE 275 INJECTOR ASSEMBLY isolating the section that we saw launched into the rings in the simulation... GALLATIN We\\'d have to remove the ignition matrix directly from the injector assembly... but in less than two minutes, that injector is going to be launched into the rings... 276 OMITTED 276 277 RESUME 277 WORF Sir, I volunteer to... Picard moves toward a transporter station, starts to Remove his jacket... PICARD Denied, Commander. I have no intention of informing your bride that you\\'re not coming home... The countdown is at 1:41... 278 INT. COLLECTOR - (OPTICAL) 278 The weird cavernous room is left with a skeleton of structured elements now that all the sails are fully unfurled... it almost reminds of the support foe an old- time roller coaster -- a cobweb of crisscrossing pipes, and conduits and planks... 279 RU\\'AFO - (OPTICAL) 279 in a control area safely removed from the injector, working controls... the digital display moving back from 1:35... he doesn\\'t immediately see -- 280 ANGLE - PICARD - (OPTICAL) 280 MATERIALIZING... near the injector. This is not an area built for manned operation... so Picard has to make do with the structural elements... he\\'s been beamed to a platform a few yards from the injector... and now he has to crawl across what is essentially a plank on his back... under the injector assembly... 281 ANGLE (OPTICAL) - LOOKING DOWN ON PICARD 281 moving across the plank... the dark recesses of the vast chamber below him... he slides into the assembly\\'s grill, with many open spaces... 282 ANGLE FAVORING HIS POV - THE IGNITION MATRIX - (OPTICAL) 282 where another digital display shows the countdown at 1:19...he takes a Son\\'a tool out of a pouch on his costume... goes to work, still lying on his back... he inserts the tool and removes the panel cover to expose the interior of the ignition matrix... 283 WITH RU\\'AFO (OPTICAL) 283 as an alarm goes off on his console...he reacts... switches off the forcefield and goes out to look up at -- 284 HIS POV - PICARD (OPTICAL) 284 working on the injector... 285 WIDE - (OPTICAL) 285 as Ru\\'afo climbs toward Picard... 286 PICARD 286 knows he\\'s running out of time now... he works on removing an interior safety screen that shields the components... it finally slips off and falls, clanging as it hits structural elements below... the countdown hits 1:09... 287 RU\\'AFO - (OPTICAL) 287 climbs... 288 PICARD - (OPTICAL) 288 reaches in to pull out the ignition matrix but a small forcefield blocks his hand... he frowns... examines the security sensors, begins to disconnect them... 289 RU\\'AFO (OPTICAL) 289 starts to cross a plank toward Picard... their eyes connect... 290 ON THE INJECTOR\\'S GRILL - (OPTICAL) 290 Picard succeeds in defeating the security system... the forcefield fritzes off... the countdown at :47... he reaches for the component but Ru\\'afo gets there first... lunges at Picard, seconds before he can complete his task. They grapple across the grill and Picard slips through one of the openings... 291 ANGLE EMPHASIZING THE FALL - (OPTICAL) 291 ... Picard barely catching himself by grabbing on to the grill... 292 RU\\'AFO 292 scrambles onto the assembly, reaches Picard and starts to uncurl... 293 PICARD\\'S FINGERS 293 holding onto the grill... trying to force him to let go... 294 PICARD - (OPTICAL) 294 grimaces, looks to see: 295 THE DIGITAL DISPLAY HITS :20 295 296 RESUME - (OPTICAL) 296 The ignition matrix engages and the nitrogen flow that follows throws Ru\\'afo slightly off-balance... Picard knowing it\\'s now or never, releases one hand and grabs Ru\\'afo by the neck and yanks his head down hard against the grill, stunning him... Picard pulls himself up and moves quickly into the blinding nitrogen toward the detonation circuit again... he literally disappears for a brief second... as Ru\\'afo comes back at him again... the countdown at :10... Ru\\'afo pulls him away from the controls... :05... Picard leaps for the plank he crawled over on... Ru\\'afo looks at... 297 HIS POV - THE DETONATION CIRCUIT 297 and it\\'s gone! 298 RU\\'AFO 298 reacts... looks at... 299 PICARD 299 on the plank who holds up the circuit for him to see... PICARD Looking for this? 300 THE DIGITAL DISPLAY - 0:00 300 301 TWO SHOT: PICARD AND RU\\'AFO - (OPTICAL) 301 perhaps no more than a foot apart... but an instant later, Ru\\'afo slides away with the injector as it\\'s launched... a protective forcefield zaps into place as it enters space... Picard watches as it moves toward the rings... 302 EXT. COLLECTOR - CONTINUOUS (OPTICAL) 302 As we saw in the simulation, the injector continues to move toward the rings... 303 INT. INJECTOR - ANGLE THROUGH THE FORCEFIELD - (OPTICAL) 303 to see the rings getting closer and closer... and as we burst into them... the bright colorful metaphasic dust and gases swirling around us like a hurricane... 304 RU\\'AFO - (OPTICAL) 304 begins to change... growing younger and younger... face- lift falls into middle-age... then taking on the Ba\\'ku facial skin pattern as he reaches young adulthood... then adolescence... then childhood. White out. 305 EXT. VILLAGE - DAY 305 The Ba\\'ku returning from the hills... Troi waves from a distance... and we move to see Riker, standing with Worf (back in uniform), waving back... WORF Have I mentioned the unanticipated rewards I\\'ve discovered in a permanent relationship...? RIKER \\'Permanent\\'... that sounds like a long time, Worf. WORF (with irony) Life is short, Commander. Worf leaves Riker to think about that... and as we move away with him, he takes us to Gallatin watching the children play tag in the high grass with a personal longing. 306 ANGLE TO SEE PICARD, ANIJ AND SOJEF - (OPTICAL) 306 walking slowly observing Gallatin. Anij is almost fully recovered. Picard is back in uniform. SOJEF I wish there was a way to bring them back home. PICARD Ask them. SOJEF I\\'m afraid there\\'s too much bitterness... on both sides. They pause as they notice Crusher escorting a young Ba\\'ku woman... returning from the mountains... she tries to recognize Gallatin... we\\'re too far away to hear what is said... but the woman embraces Gallatin as a mother embraces a lost son... and Crusher looks over and smiles to Picard... before she leaves the couple alone... Anij looks to Picard, realizing -- ANIJ Mother and son. You arranged this...? PICARD I thought it might begin the healing process. Sojef considers Picard, shakes his hand with a unstated but deep appreciation for all that this offlander has done. He moves away to join Gallatin and his mother. Anij looks to Picard with love. ANIJ What am I going to do without you? Picard reacts, slightly surprised that she has anticipated that he has to go. PICARD These are perilous times for the Federation. I can\\'t abandon it to people who would threaten everything I\\'ve spent a lifetime defending. PICARD (CONT\\'D) I\\'m going back to Earth to... slow things down... at the Federation Council. She nods, she knows... PICARD But I have three hundred and eighteen days of vacation time coming. I plan on using them. ANIJ I\\'ll be here. Worf moves over... WORF Captain, the Ticonderoga has moved into orbit. QUARK\\'S VOICE Worf! They turn to see a Ferengi (QUARK) approaching in a bathing suit with a beach umbrella and two barely dressed Dabo girls... WORF What are you doing here, Quark? QUARK The same thing everyone else in the quadrant is going to be doing here... as soon as I build the greatest spa in the galaxy... (sotto) ... these people don\\'t have any religious thing about casinos do they...? PICARD There aren\\'t going to be any spas on this planet. QUARK Do I know you? PICARD (ignoring the question) This world is about to become a Federation protectorate, which will end any and all attempts at exploitation by people like you. QUARK Explain to me how five thousand time-share units... right there along the lake... would be \\'exploiting\\' anyone. PICARD Mister Worf, have this uninvited... offlander and his quests beamed to the Enterprise. We\\'ll deposit them at Deep Space Nine. WORF Must you, sir? Worf takes Quark away by the scruff of his beach shirt... his disappointed babes follow ...trailing away -- QUARK You\\'ll hear from my Nagus. They\\'re gone. ANIJ Do you really think your mighty Federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people? PICARD The \"mighty\" Federation could learn a few things from this village... He kisses her. The signature humming bird appears, sweeping up in the breeze and hovers briefly in front of them... and as he takes her hand to his cheek... 307 THE HUMMING BIRD (OPTICAL) 307 slows... its wing movements becoming more fluid and gentle... as the moment extends... 308 ANGLE ON TROI, CRUSHER, WORF, LA FORGE AND RIKER 308 prepared to transport... LA FORGE Where\\'s Data? 309 ANGLE - THE HIGH GRASS 309 a shot like our opening shot...except the head that peeks through the grass this time is Data\\'s... and as we widen, we see he has taken Artim\\'s earlier advice and is playing tag with all the kids... CRUSHER (calling) Data! It\\'s time to go! Data stands up straight as he hears the voice, looks at Artim a long beat... and this is a kid\\'s moment, underplaying the sentiment the way kids would... DATA I have to go home now. ARTIM Bye. Data nods... DATA Bye. Artim smiles as Data joins the others... ARTIM Don\\'t forget -- you\\'ve got to play a little bit every day. Data acknowledges... RIKER Good advice. Riker takes Troi\\'s hand suggesting perhaps a new permanent commitment. Picard moves to join the others, presses his combadge. PICARD Enterprise... seven to beam up. Energize. Picard exchanges a final look with Anij as they DEMATERIALIZE. 310 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE - (OPTICAL) 310 leaves orbit and as it moves into space... FADE OUT. THE END'"
